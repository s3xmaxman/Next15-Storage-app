00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey guys, this is Ed Rowe.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,640
So today we're going to be building this complete full stack learning management application

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,520
with a Next.js front end, Node.js back end, and most importantly, fully deployed on AWS.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,840
So this application is probably one of the most extensive applications I've ever built on YouTube.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
And I might even use this for my own purposes of creating a course.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,280
So this is a production-ready application with its own set of use cases.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,520
All right, so here we have our landing page with the loading screen when it pops up.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
And you can see some animations happening.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
And then from here, we can hit search for courses.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,400
And we can see all our courses being listed.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,800
And we can see different details about each course if we want to take a look at those.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
And from here, we can hit sign up for creating our account.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,080
So now this is part of Clerk authentication.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,200
All of this is provided by Clerk to make it easy.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,520
So I am going to create an account.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm going to call this toughhuff for the first and last name.

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,440
The email is going to be bigtoughyhuffy@gmail.com.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,600
And I'm just going to add some kind of password.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
And over here, after signing up, we can see our verification code.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm going to copy that, paste it over here.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,080
And we have our email verified for an account.

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
Once we are signed in, we can see this list of courses page.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
We can see billing information for the users.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,680
We can see their profile information.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
And this is provided by Clerk.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
You have ability to see the profile and security as well.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,440
And then over here, you can see the settings page.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,960
And you should be able to update your settings if you would like.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,680
You can see that we have a little bit of a tag which says user updated successfully,

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
which is very nice.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,120
In the billing, once we have a transaction, we'd be able to sort it based on payment types.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
And we can then go to courses.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Over here in the courses, we have the list of courses that are available.

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
And this is right now just mock data.

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
And if we want to search up courses, we can do advanced, things like that.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
And then we can even select for specific categories.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,840
Now, it says view only because this is a list of all the courses that

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
everyone's created in the application.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,600
But if we wanted to create our own course, we can select create course.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,080
And it'll take us to this page.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
Now, this page is going to include a number of course titles.

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
So let's say test this course.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,800
And we're just going to write some random description.

44
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,960
We're going to put course category.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
And we're going to give it a price of 30.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
Now, over here, we can add a section if we would like.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,040
We can do section one, put some description over here.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
And we need to make sure it's over 10 seconds or 10 letters.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
And then we can add a chapter as well.

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,960
Chapter one, so on and so forth.

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,960
And then from here, I can now add a video.

52
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,560
We can add any video for our chapter video.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
And that's going to represent the video we have for that specific chapter.

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,240
And then we can also add more sections if we would like.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,920
Write a description.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,720
We can save it and we can even reorder the sections as we want to.

57
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,360
And then from here, I can add a second chapter.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,960
We're going to add some content.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,200
And we are going to select a different video.

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
And we are going to hit save.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,240
So right now, we have not uploaded this video.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,520
So right now, all of these changes are temporary because it's not saved on the back end.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:45,040
However, if I hit save draft, you should see that we have created a upload URL,

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
which has been sent to the front end.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
The front end is going to get a pre-signed URL from S3.

66
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
And we are going to upload our video.

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
We're uploading each video one at a time.

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,680
That's why you're seeing another upload URL right here.

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,840
And then we have another video uploaded.

70
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
And the course now has been fully updated successfully.

71
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
So that is perfectly fine.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
And everything is working as expected.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
If we go back to the courses page, we can see our course has been created.

74
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,080
Test this course.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,240
Now, before we go to the course and see what's been uploaded and been created,

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,280
let's actually see that we have both an edit and delete.

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,680
So if you were to create a course and have some course information and hit back to courses,

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,920
you can see the course that we've created.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
Over here, we can select delete.

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
And we can also be able to delete the course as well to see the changes.

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
And there you go.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
It is gone.

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,320
So now, if we want to see what's happening in this course,

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,720
we can now sign out of this account.

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
And it'll take us back to our landing page.

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,320
And this is where things get pretty cool.

87
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
We can go search for courses.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,120
And over here, we are looking for test this course, which is a course we have created.

89
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,280
We can see the sections that we have created.

90
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
Chapter one, chapter two.

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,440
Obviously, you would put actual information.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
You can hit enroll now.

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
And now you can see this is our checkout page.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
We can see our course information as well as the price.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,760
And you can see that there's a guest checkout and a sign in page for our course.

96
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,960
Or you can also do sign up, which is on the same exact checkout page.

97
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,560
So let's do that because the other user was a teacher.

98
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Only teachers can create courses.

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
But this time, we are going to create a user.

100
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,560
And we're just going to call this some dumb for the user.

101
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
We're going to say just some dummy email.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
And we're going to add a password like this.

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,560
And once you have this completed, it also has validation, which is very nice from Clerk.

104
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
And we're going to hit continue.

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,200
And we're going to be asked for verifying our email.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,600
So I'm going to go to my email off screen.

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
And I'm going to paste the code.

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
And it's going to say we are verified.

109
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
And it's going to take us to this page now, the second page of our application.

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
And again, we have the same course preview.

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
And over here, we are going to be using Stripe.

112
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,760
Now the Stripe credit card fake like testing value.

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,960
So you don't actually use real money is going to be 42424242 like so.

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,480
And from here, we can just put whatever expiration date and security code and zip code.

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,880
Just FYI, if you put something like 20, it's going to show that there's validation.

116
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
So all of this is provided by Stripe.

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,000
And it's very cool that it gives you all this information.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
And you can also have secure one click checkout with link.

119
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,680
But this is completely optional, and you can ignore it.

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
So when we're done with that, we can hit pay with credit card.

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
And it's going to say purchase course successfully.

122
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
And it's going to show that we have purchased the course successfully.

123
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,200
From here, we can hit go to courses.

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,720
And once we have our courses, now we're going to be seeing our courses list page.

125
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,440
Now this is the only course that this user has enrolled in, which is what we just purchased.

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,880
But before we click on the course, I want to show you that we also have a profile account for

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,560
this particular user.

128
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
We can also do user settings as well.

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
Save that and we can have the user updated successfully.

130
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,080
And from there, we can go to billing.

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,200
And we can see that we have a payment history of Stripe as well right here.

132
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,560
And then finally, let's go to our course and select this.

133
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,240
And we are taken to this awesome course page.

134
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
Now we can see the videos that we have uploaded.

135
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,760
And this is pretty awesome.

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,400
Now there's no sound for this because it's just a video.

137
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,640
And we go scroll through.

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,200
And by the way, once you're at 80% of the video upload right here, you can see that it gets

139
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,560
marked as complete.

140
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
You can do the same for the next video.

141
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,120
We'll go over here.

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,480
And this will also get marked complete as well.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,160
And you can mark it so it's unmarked like this.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,280
You can see that it's on incomplete now once you select this button.

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
I've seen other learning management application, but I don't think any of them have this functionality

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,880
of completed and uncompleted check of their user progress, which is very important for

147
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,600
this.

148
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,400
And there you go.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,480
This is our application.

150
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,760
And we'll also even go through with our courses.

151
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,600
I'll show you how you can create this particular sidebar.

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,040
This is an awesome sidebar that ShadCN just created.

153
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,320
So we're going to be using this sidebar to make everything work properly.

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
And finally, everything in our application is going to be responsive.

155
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,040
You'll be able to see your application at different screen sizes and everything should

156
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,640
work perfectly fine.

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,240
And because our application is production level and it is full scale, we have a lot

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
of diagrams for this application.

159
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
In the link in the description, you'll be able to go to this page and see everything

160
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,120
you need to know about this application.

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,680
First, you can see that we have app screen design.

162
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,160
So this is a screenshot of every single page in our application.

163
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,640
So you can know and build the application if you have the desire without looking at

164
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,200
my video.

165
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,920
If you want to take that challenge, you can completely do so by looking at these designs

166
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,040
and then recreating.

167
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,800
Secondly, we have the entity relationship diagram.

168
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,920
Basically, this is a diagram of all the data schemas, data models that we are going to

169
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,760
incorporate in our application.

170
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
And this is the structure of our data.

171
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,160
And I'll go very much in detail and why we chose this particular database.

172
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,480
And then we'll go through different aspects such as authentication flow in Clerk.

173
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
And then we'll go through checkout flow of how that works.

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
And then we'll go through a course editor.

175
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,240
And finally, and most importantly, you'd probably be most excited with is the AWS

176
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
architecture.

177
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm going to go through in depth of how we can set and deploy this application onto Clerk,

178
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,240
Bracel, API Gateway, Lambda, ECR, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront.

179
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,080
So a link in the description if you want to go to this particular diagram.

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,960
All right, from here, let's talk about the tech stack we're going to be using for this

181
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,680
application.

182
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,280
For the front end, we're going to be using Next.js, Redux Toolkit for state management,

183
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,600
Redux Toolkit Query for API interactions.

184
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
The styling will be handled by Tailwind CSS, along with ShadCN for component library,

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,960
TypeScript for typings, Framer Motion for animation, React Hook for forms, Zot for

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,560
validation, and Stripe for payment.

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,400
I also mentioned that we are using a separate backend that is not part of Next.js because

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,800
it makes the application more scalable and prevents front end become too tightly coupled

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,440
to backend.

190
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
Hence, our application will be running with Node.js and Express Framework.

191
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,120
Now, more and more, I really, really want to emphasize this is the most important part

192
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,120
is that this app is not like others where we are using services like AppWrite or Convex.

193
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,840
This is an actual enterprise level application.

194
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,800
Now, don't get me wrong.

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Those are those services that manage your backend aren't wrong per se or evil in any

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
kind of way.

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
They do have their purposes for small scale applications.

198
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,800
But I want you to really understand that it really takes away the capacity to really

199
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,600
customize and scale out your application at affordable cost for large companies, which

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
is one of the worst things you can do for your development career.

201
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,520
More and more with the age and the coming of AI and in this rough job market, you're

202
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,320
going to be expected to learn more than just front end.

203
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,720
And if you really want to survive, you're going to have to learn backend and deployment.

204
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,920
So in this video, I'm going to do the best that I can to make this step by step and make

205
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,200
sure it is super easy for you to follow and make sure you understand every aspect of the

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
enterprise level of tech, including backend data modeling and AWS.

207
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,400
So for AWS, we're going to deploy our application on AWS with the modern serverless

208
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
containerized architecture.

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,520
Our backend is going to be dockerized using Docker, allowing us to package our app into

210
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,200
a very consistent environment.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,680
This container is then going to be stored in ECR, Elastic Container Registry, which

212
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,520
will then be used with AWS Lambda for hosting our backend.

213
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,280
We'll then be using API gateway to securely route requests to Lambda, while DynamoDB

214
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,320
serves as our NoSQL database for fast, scalable storage of application data.

215
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,040
And when it comes to our video content in our application, S3 will be used for handling

216
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
that storage.

217
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,440
Finally, we're going to ensure our videos are delivered with low latency and high

218
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,320
availability.

219
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
That's why we'll use CloudFront as our content delivery network.

220
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,640
And finally, included in these tools is going to be Clerk Authentication, which is the

221
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,920
sponsor for this video.

222
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,400
Clerk is a very nice tool for authentication.

223
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,000
Now, when it comes to authentication, you can definitely use something like AWS Cognito

224
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,960
as part of AWS.

225
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,920
I tried it myself, but even I ran into some trouble.

226
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,800
Cognito can be restrictive in certain ways and requires a lot of complex setup.

227
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Whereas Clerk, on the other hand, offers a lot of easy pre-made tools for your application,

228
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,800
as you saw in the demo, having pre-built settings, sign in, sign up components, user buttons,

229
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
along with a lot of other really useful features.

230
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
And we'll get to that in this video, but Clerk makes managing users and adding users

231
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
roles super straightforward.

232
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,240
And their documentation is very good, so you'll have no trouble setting up Clerk.

233
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Now, just for you guys to note, specifically for authentication, this is the one area where

234
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,840
it's perfectly fine to use an external service outside of AWS.

235
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,800
Authentication is a very tricky area, and having a dedicated company focused on authentication

236
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,200
can sometimes even be better than using something like Cognito, which requires extensive and

237
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
careful implementation to get just right.

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Anyways, we'll finally then use Vercel for hosting our Next.js front end to integrate

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
smoothly with the rest of our AWS services.

240
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,840
So this architecture combines Docker's AWS serverless and storage capacities and global

241
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,560
CDN to create a very scalable application.

242
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,720
Now, don't worry if this setup seems complex.

243
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
I'm going to break down every step and guide you through the process using very simple

244
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,400
terminology, making it accessible for beginners.

245
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,600
As always, I designed this application myself, so you are free to use parts or even the entire

246
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
project for your portfolio.

247
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Let's dive in and start building.

248
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,640
So the first thing we're going to be doing is we're going to be installing Node.js.

249
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:15,200
So Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime built on the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.

250
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,720
Basically means that you can run JavaScript code on your computer.

251
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,160
So go to the link in the description and you can install Node.js.

252
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,720
And then from here, we're going to be installing NPX.

253
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,760
So NPX will help us install some npm package binaries.

254
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,480
So if you go to the link in the description, you can run npm install -g npx.

255
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,640
And then for our text editor, we can use Visual Studio Code.

256
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,960
I'd probably recommend this text code editor, but you can use other options if you want

257
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,600
to use those.

258
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,840
All right, so open up VS Code and open up a directory where you want to create the project.

259
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,560
Once you have done that, we're going to open up the terminal via control apostrophe.

260
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:01,200
We're going to open this up and we are going to write npx create-next-app @latest.

261
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,560
And we're just going to say y.

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,720
And we're going to call this learning-management.

263
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Hit yes, yes, yes, yes.

264
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Basically yes and no to the defaults.

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,680
And then from here, I'm going to write ls so we can see that we created that directory.

266
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,200
And then we're going to open up our folder directory, rename this to client.

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,040
We're going to change directory into client.

268
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,120
And before we do anything else, we're going to go to the extensions tab.

269
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,240
And what you want to do is go to es7 plus.

270
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,400
You want to make sure you have react/redux/react-native snippets.

271
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,680
So we're going to be using this to create our React components easily.

272
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,640
And also, you want to make sure you have the prettier extension so that we have the code

273
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,040
formatting when we save it.

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
So make sure you install these two extensions.

275
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,240
Then from here, we're going to install two Brave extensions.

276
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,080
We're going to install pesticide.

277
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,040
So this will allow us to see our CSS.

278
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,960
And we can see how our entire website is structured via the div and how it's layout.

279
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,360
And then also Redux DevTools, which will help us debug our Redux state when we use it.

280
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,560
So from here, we're going to be installing some packages in our client directory.

281
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,240
So I'm going to write npm i lucide-react.

282
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,160
So this is for icons.

283
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,240
UUID for unique IDs.env for environment variables.

284
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
Date-fns for date function utilities.

285
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
Framer-motion for animations.

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,880
React-hook-form for forms.

287
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,600
Zod for form validation.

288
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,440
@hook-form/resolvers.

289
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,440
And @hello-pangea/dnd.

290
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,760
Now, currently, this is November 10, 2024, which is when I'm recording this.

291
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,200
If you take a look, I am using Next 15, which is using React Canary 19, meaning this is

292
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,800
almost like an unstable version, but they say it's stable.

293
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,640
But it's going to have some issues with these packages.

294
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,560
So, for example, React-hook-form is not going to be compatible with this particular one.

295
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,080
So we are going to have to use --legacy/peer-dps.

296
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,520
Or you can use --force.

297
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,960
But basically, this will install some peer dependencies that are older.

298
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,000
Now, if you're in the future and React 19 is more stable and some of these packages

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,120
get updated to be more compatible, you might not have to use this.

300
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
But for now, we're going to be using this.

301
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,400
There might be potential bugs because some packages might not be compatible with 19.

302
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
But we'll just give this a shot.

303
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,800
All right.

304
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,400
And then from here, we're going to have to install some dev dependencies.

305
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
So I'm going to do npm i -D.

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,440
I'm going to do @types/node and then @types/uuid.

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,280
And I'm going to write --legacy/peer-dps.

308
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,680
So from here, now, there is going to be a link in the description.

309
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,520
I have a link to asset download.

310
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,360
So this will include a bunch of assets that I have prepared.

311
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:58,080
And this is including mainly a lot of TypeScript and some util functions as well as pre-made CSS

312
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,560
classes.

313
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,520
This application is much less about styling.

314
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,000
Because in the previous videos, I've spent a long time styling, doing all of that creation,

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,800
which I don't know how much teaching value there is for me to just style it right in

316
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
front of you.

317
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
It does take a lot of time.

318
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,520
But I want to focus more on the logical and functional aspect of this application, which

319
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
is generally much more interesting.

320
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
And I do think it is much more valuable for teaching content.

321
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,640
But let me know what you guys think about this idea.

322
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Anyways, get that asset download file.

323
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
And we're going to drag it over here.

324
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
And I'm just going to say copy folder.

325
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
And we're going to put it into here.

326
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,160
And you're going to see client and server.

327
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
And it's going to have a bunch of files.

328
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
We're going to just focus on one thing at a time.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,880
The first thing I want to do is I'm going to drag globals.css.

330
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
And we're going to replace global CSS like this.

331
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,080
I'm going to close that.

332
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,600
We'll come back to the assets later.

333
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,080
But for now, what I want you to see is that I have a huge host of so many classes.

334
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,200
Because we are not going to spend time doing styling for this application.

335
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,080
We're just going to be using those classes for our styles.

336
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,480
They are already using Tailwind classes.

337
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
We're going to be using those.

338
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,040
And we're just going to apply those classes directly onto those components.

339
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:39,280
In a future video, I do have a very soon upcoming video where I cover CSS and how to do it.

340
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,520
That is the video you should probably watch if you ever want to do styling.

341
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,440
Anyways, if you see here, I have an import, which is the main thing I wanted to show you.

342
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,640
This is what we're going to import.

343
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,640
We're going to import a Google font of DM Sans.

344
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
And we're going to set this up in our application.

345
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
So I'm going to go to layout.

346
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,200
Go up over here.

347
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:14,080
I'm going to import DM underscore Sans from next slash font slash Google.

348
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,560
And from here, I'm going to remove these local fonts because we're not going to use those.

349
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,760
We're going to do const DM Sans is equal to DM underscore Sans.

350
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,400
And we're going to say subsets colon Latin like.

351
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
So display is going to be swap.

352
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,440
And this is just all set up for our font.

353
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,640
And we're just going to do dash dash font dash DM dash Sans.

354
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to erase the local font.

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm going to go down to our class name.

356
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm going to erase all of this.

357
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,160
And I'm just going to do DM Sans dot class name like so.

358
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,040
And close it like this and paste it.

359
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,000
So we'll have our font up and ready.

360
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,720
And then from here, I'm going to delete this font folder.

361
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
And I'm going to go to page.tsx.

362
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,560
And I'm just going to delete everything in our div and just say,

363
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,800
"Hi, get rid of all these classes because we don't need them."

364
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,000
Remove the image.

365
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,880
We're going to save it.

366
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
And we just want to make sure everything is running.

367
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,960
So I'm going to write npm run dev.

368
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
So that's how we start our next application.

369
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,600
So we can now go to HTTP local host.

370
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,680
We're going to paste it in our browser.

371
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,240
And we're going to get this error.

372
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,680
And that's because we haven't placed a lot of the configurations that we need.

373
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,920
So we're going to go to our asset downloads.

374
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,720
And we're going to start importing everything or moving everything that we need.

375
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
So we're going to have a components folder.

376
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,880
So I'm going to just drag this components into our source directory.

377
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,160
That's going to be for later images.

378
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:16,000
We're going to grab all of these images, place them in public, keep it over there.

379
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,840
And we have lib with schemas and utils.

380
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,560
We're going to cover a lot of these things as we go along.

381
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
So I'm going to pass this into source.

382
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm going to drag the state as well.

383
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,520
So that's going to be for our Redux that we'll do very shortly.

384
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,680
I'm going to drag in types as well.

385
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,000
And finally, I'm going to drag Tailwind config actually into our client directory.

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,680
And we are going to replace the Tailwind config that we have in our global directory.

387
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:56,240
Now this Tailwind config consists of a lot, a lot of setup that we have with primary,

388
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,040
secondary, a bunch of colors, border radius, and some shad-cn preparation.

389
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,840
We're going to have all of these all set up in our configuration.

390
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,360
So with all of that, we still can't see our server just yet.

391
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,800
So if you see require Tailwind CSS-Animate, we're going to have to install this.

392
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,080
So we're going to do npm tailwind css-animate because this is part of the Tailwind config

393
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,800
that we added.

394
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,520
And we also need to do --legacy-peer-dps.

395
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,120
Install that.

396
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,320
And once we have that, you can ignore the linting error.

397
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
We're going to just do npm run dev.

398
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,520
And from here, we should actually be able to see the server.

399
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,800
If I go to it, you can see that we just have "Hi" at the very top.

400
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,400
Now if you do have some other weird issues and it's still not working, you can delete

401
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,200
.next.

402
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,480
You can delete this folder and then just close out rerun npm run dev if you have any issues.

403
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,040
All right, cool.

404
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,040
And then from here, we're going to finish setting up our Tailwind and we're going to

405
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,040
be installing shad-cn as well.

406
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,960
So we're going to configure all of this to make sure everything is going to work as

407
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
expected.

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
So now I did drop in Tailwind config.

409
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
I just want to briefly go over what's happening.

410
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,080
A lot of this is custom styling that is provided both by shad-cn, which already provided it,

411
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,840
but also custom colors that I put myself.

412
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,960
So custom grays is a color that I wanted to put.

413
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,920
Primary bg.

414
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,520
So these are different shades of colors that I wanted.

415
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,640
And then primary is more like a purple color.

416
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,720
Secondary is like a slightly light green color.

417
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,160
And these are defaults provided by shad-cn when we install them.

418
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,640
So those will already be there.

419
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,080
So I'm going to remove that.

420
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,400
But let's get on.

421
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,360
The first thing I want you to do is go to extensions and we're going to be able to see

422
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,840
a Tailwind extension CSS IntelliSense.

423
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,840
So give this one an install.

424
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,400
It's going to allow you to see all the Tailwind classes as you type it.

425
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,160
So it makes it a lot easier.

426
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,880
And also, if you want, you can install Tailwind documentation, which provides little Tailwind

427
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,280
documentation that you can open up if you want to search directly in VS Code.

428
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,480
This is up to you.

429
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,840
I use it sometimes.

430
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
Sometimes now I just Google it.

431
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,480
It doesn't really matter.

432
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,240
And once you have that installed, we're going to go back to our directory, open up our terminal,

433
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
and I'm going to start installing shad-cn libraries.

434
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,920
So the first thing you want to do is npx shad-cn @latest init -d.

435
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,840
So anytime you want to start installing shad-cn libraries, this is how you want to begin.

436
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:10,400
And like I said, with React 19, which is supposedly unstable, we're going to use legacy-pure-deps.

437
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
All right.

438
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,480
So unfortunately, if you go to the utils, it basically updated and replaced my utils

439
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,280
file, which I did not expect.

440
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,600
So if you go back to your asset download, I'm just going to delete everything.

441
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm going to copy the entire asset download that we had earlier.

442
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,400
So I'm going to paste the asset download over here.

443
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,160
We can have everything all set up back again.

444
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:44,000
So if you go back to lib utils, basically has all the normal class names that you would

445
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
expect, but it has a lot more.

446
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,480
So I'm just going to copy this time.

447
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm not going to drag it, but I'm going to replace it over here.

448
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,400
So I'm going to delete this, rename this to utils.

449
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,480
This has a lot more functions and constants that we are going to be using.

450
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,600
I didn't want to spend the time to give you guys utils functions or like have you guys

451
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,800
write them because they're just basically logic questions that you have to figure out

452
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,360
yourself.

453
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,880
Anyways, we're going to close all of this and we have shad-cn installed.

454
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,800
And then from here, we're going to install a bunch of sad shad-cn libraries, or basically

455
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,880
components, I mean, if you don't understand how shad-cn works, it installs every single

456
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,320
component one at a time, but we're going to install a good number of them.

457
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:48,880
So we're going to first add an accordion avatar button card, dialogue, form, input, label,

458
00:28:48,880 --> 00:29:04,400
navigation-menu, popover, progress, select, separator, sheet, sidebar, skeleton, switch,

459
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,360
table, tabs, text area, toggle, and tooltip.

460
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,720
I know there's a lot, but we're going to go through as we build the application.

461
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,160
And again, we're going to use legacy-peer-deps.

462
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,080
And then once you have that installed, we can go to tailwind-config.ts.

463
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
It does replace this for some reason.

464
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,440
This should not be a string.

465
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,960
I don't know why I replaced that.

466
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
So we're just going to replace it to be true.

467
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,000
Close that.

468
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
And we want to double check that we have our components.

469
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,760
So if it's working, you could see in our components folder, another separate folder

470
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,840
called UI, and it should have all our components in there.

471
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,200
And you should also see another folder called hooks.

472
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
And we're going to see use-mobile.

473
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,520
It has added that.

474
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,640
And then from here, we're going to go back to client and we're going to add tailwind-class-ordering.

475
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,840
Basically, it's going to order our tailwind CSS classes if it needs to.

476
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,080
So this is entirely optional.

477
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,160
npm i -d prettier-plugin-tailwind-css.

478
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,360
We're going to do legacy-peer-deps.

479
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:27,280
And we just have to go to tailwind-config.ts.

480
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,000
Go down to plugins all the way down over here.

481
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,680
And we're just going to write comma prettier-plugin-tailwind-css.

482
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,960
And then finally, let's just give it one more shot just to make sure everything is working.

483
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,120
We're going to go back to localhost, refresh the page,

484
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,200
and we should see that it's still exactly the same.

485
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
This is what you expect.

486
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,360
As long as you don't have an error, you are good to go.

487
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,400
All right.

488
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,760
So from here, we're going to be installing Redux Toolkit.

489
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,360
Now, we're going to close this client out.

490
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,560
I've already created a folder called state, which I dragged from the asset downloads.

491
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,720
If you remember, we have an API file, we have an index, and we have Redux.

492
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,520
So we're going to first install the packages we need for these files.

493
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:32,960
So I'm going to do npm i react-redux@reduxjs/toolkit.env.

494
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,280
Actually, we already installed .env.

495
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,400
I'm going to do legacy-peer-deps.

496
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,960
All right.

497
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,920
So now, before I used to make you guys copy, but now we just have this folder.

498
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,880
I have this folder that I told you to just drag without us having to do much else.

499
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,680
There's a few last things we actually need to set up.

500
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,960
So I'm going to create a new file called providers.

501
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,800
So this is a place where we want to keep all the providers or anything that

502
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,480
needs to be put on the global state for our Next.js application.

503
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,480
So over here, I'm going to write use client.

504
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,840
And we are going to import react from react like so.

505
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,400
We're going to import store provider from at/state-redux.

506
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,240
So that comes from this file.

507
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,000
So this file includes everything we need to create our Redux store.

508
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,480
So we're just going to import that.

509
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,280
And I'm going to create providers component.

510
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:48,080
We're going to use children colon and children colon react.react node.

511
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,680
Return.

512
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:56,400
And we're going to pass in store provider.

513
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,240
And we're going to pass in children like so.

514
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,040
And we're just going to make sure we do export default providers.

515
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,360
With this, we're going to go to our page directory.

516
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,520
Actually, my mistake.

517
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,280
Go to layout directory.

518
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,680
And around our body, I'm going to bring in providers.

519
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:27,840
From the directory that we just created, we're going to make sure that goes around the children.

520
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,640
And this is all we have to do to set up Redux.

521
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,240
All right.

522
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,080
So from here, we are going to create a file called dot env dot local.

523
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,640
And we're just going to set we're going to go to our Redux, our API file, we're going to see

524
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,800
process dot env dot next public API base URL.

525
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,240
So basically, anytime we make an API request, this is the base URL that we're going to be

526
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,640
using.

527
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,760
So we're just going to copy this guy right here.

528
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,200
Go over here.

529
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,400
Paste that environment variable.

530
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:15,520
And we're just going to do HTTP colon slash slash local host colon 8001.

531
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,120
That is where our server is going to be hosted.

532
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,040
And we're going to take care of that a little later.

533
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,720
And there you go.

534
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,040
Our Redux is basically set up.

535
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,800
One of these days, I might create a little bit of a tool that will automatically set

536
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
this up for you, which will make things easy.

537
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
But we'll see if that happens.

538
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,720
All right.

539
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,200
So now with all of this set up, we can actually start building our application.

540
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:47,840
So we can go and there is a link in the description to get to this specific page where we can see

541
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,120
different pages of our design.

542
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Right here, I have set up a very detailed page where it includes our entire application.

543
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,440
Now, these are screenshots.

544
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,800
These are not Figma designs.

545
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,360
So it's probably not as good as quality.

546
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,200
But the application turned out a little different from the Figma designs that I've created.

547
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,640
But we can see that we have search pages.

548
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,440
And we're going to start with the landing page and the search pages for our course.

549
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,160
Now, if you want to see the final application, it would look something like this.

550
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,160
On refresh, you'll see a loading page and you can see some animations.

551
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,120
And you should be able to click search for courses and see these particular pages.

552
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,440
All right.

553
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,080
So to start off, I move the application on the right side and I'm going to close this

554
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,640
over here.

555
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,640
I'm going to open up the page component over here in the app directory.

556
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,320
And we're going to start building over here.

557
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,040
Inside our home directory, I'm going to put a class name of non-dashboard layout.

558
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,960
So this will set up the layout for our non-dashboard page.

559
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,200
And I'm going to call this non-dashboard navbar.

560
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,760
So I collectively called this particular area of the application where we have search pages,

561
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,880
authentication pages, checkout pages as non-dashboard.

562
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,680
Everything else right here, as you can see, these are the pages where we actually have

563
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,200
a dashboard layout.

564
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,600
And this is when you are signed in.

565
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,240
You can see a dashboard that's relevant to you.

566
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Whereas these are non-dashboard pages.

567
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,560
Let me close that so you guys can see a little better.

568
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,000
So we are starting with the search page and we are going to create this particular navbar

569
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,800
over here.

570
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,320
So I'm going to close that out, create a non-dashboard navbar, and I'm going to import

571
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
non-dashboard.

572
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,720
Navbar like so.

573
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:58,080
And we're going to do from at slash components slash non-dashboard navbar.

574
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm going to save that and we are going to go to our components directory and I'm going

575
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,880
to create a new file.

576
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,440
I'm going to call this non-dashboard navbar dot TSX.

577
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,000
Close this out.

578
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
Get some space.

579
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,560
Actually, RAFCE.

580
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,000
So we don't have any types because this is not going to take anything.

581
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,680
And we are going to create our navbar from here.

582
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,720
So I'm going to erase all of this and we're going to add a nav element over here.

583
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,480
So this is important for, you know, HTML element semantics.

584
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,000
So make sure you understand that.

585
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,960
We're going to have non-dashboard navbar.

586
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,200
And inside here, I'm just going to write hello, just so we can see that this is being

587
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,320
inputted.

588
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,520
Now, sometimes the linting does not work properly.

589
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
So you're going to have to retype it and it'll import it correctly.

590
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,000
So right now we don't see it on our application because we haven't run.

591
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,520
So open up your terminal and write npm run dev.

592
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,440
Make sure it's running.

593
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
And I'm going to refresh the page.

594
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,920
And as you can see, we now have hello for the navbar, just to see that we have the navbar

595
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,600
written over here.

596
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,400
So we're just going to quickly erase that and we're going to add some divs.

597
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:32,880
So we're going to have a class name of non-dashboard navbar double underscore container.

598
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,440
Now, when you see this, this type of naming is called block element modifier.

599
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:48,720
Typically, right now I do have all the classes set up over here in global CSS.

600
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,360
You can see that a lot of these classes, let's just search up non-dashboard navbar.

601
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,080
They have a bunch of tailwind classes all applied.

602
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,840
And I'm doing this because I don't want to focus on CSS.

603
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,200
Like I mentioned, these are already pre-made, but I am using something called block element

604
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,760
modifier.

605
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,440
So that is basically you start with the relevant element and then you write whatever is the

606
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,040
class it's relevant to.

607
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,080
This is just an easy way to organize.

608
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,920
Now in a real production application, I would probably not do class names like this.

609
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
I would probably leave the tailwind classes as is.

610
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,040
But if you ever wanted to use block element modifier, you can do it this way.

611
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
But specifically for tutorial purposes.

612
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,120
Anyways, let's get back to it.

613
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,400
We're going to import link.

614
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,040
And if you see what I'm doing as I'm typing, I have linting coming in, which shows what

615
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
we're going to import.

616
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Make sure you use that because it's very important because it gives you both ease of

617
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,480
use and getting used to that prevents errors.

618
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,120
Because sometimes if you don't do it correctly, you're going to have typos and you're not

619
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,960
exactly sure what happens.

620
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,840
So it's good practice to use those typings.

621
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:16,880
So right here we have a link and I put non-dashboard navbar brand that gives us a link to our home

622
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,200
page.

623
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:25,040
Below this, I'm going to write div with the class name of flex items center and a gap

624
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,840
of four.

625
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,560
So the items will be flexed below and we're going to do class name with relative and we

626
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
are going to group it.

627
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,880
Inside here, we're going to add a search input.

628
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,000
So we're going to import link once again.

629
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
We're going to have an href of search.

630
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,280
And this will just take us to a search page.

631
00:40:52,560 --> 00:41:01,600
And we're going to give it a class name of non-dashboard-navbar double underscore search

632
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,000
input.

633
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,440
Inside here, I'm going to do a span with the class name and we're going to say it's

634
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,840
hidden.

635
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:16,400
And it's going to be in line for any screens that are above small sizes.

636
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
So this is going to say search courses.

637
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,720
And you can see we have a little search bar right here.

638
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,920
But right now, we don't have the text.

639
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,440
So we're going to add another span and we are going to say hidden for small screens.

640
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,480
So we are making sure these are responsive designs.

641
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,040
So as you can see, we have a search bar.

642
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,280
If you open up, it goes to search courses like this.

643
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,920
And then from here, we're going to import book open, which is an icon from Lucide React.

644
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm going to do class name of non-dashboard-navbar double underscore search icon with the size

645
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
of 18.

646
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:13,760
And as you can see, we have now an icon opens up and it will take us to a search page.

647
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,600
We're not going to click on it because we don't have a search page just yet.

648
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,440
So as of right now, we have these two sets.

649
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,000
We're going to actually go below the three divs and we are going to create another div.

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,320
So this will represent the right side.

651
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:37,600
And we're going to have a class name of non-dashboard-navbar double underscore actions.

652
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:45,440
And in here, I'm going to say button with the class name of non-dashboard-navbar

653
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,400
double underscore notifications button.

654
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,960
Close that out.

655
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,840
We're going to put a span with the class name and give it a non-dashboard.

656
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,760
Actually, let's just copy all of this so we can make this easier.

657
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,720
Dash indicator.

658
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,480
And we are going to close this span.

659
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,960
And finally, we're going to put a span.

660
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,600
Finally, we're going to give it the bell icon.

661
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,400
So this is for the bell icon with notifications.

662
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,640
We're not adding notification functionality for this particular application,

663
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,920
but it is there if you want to add the functionality for a bit of stretch goal.

664
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,480
So we have the bell icon.

665
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,280
We have the search.

666
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,120
And it does seem I did miss something.

667
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,840
So the search courses should be on the left side.

668
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,400
If you take a look at the final application, it should be on the left side, not on the right side.

669
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
So there was a div that we did miss.

670
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:57,040
And so right above the link of Edbro, we're going to write div class name is equal to non-dashboard-navbar.

671
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,120
But this should be search right here.

672
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,960
Close this out with the div and we're going to wrap it around right here.

673
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,760
And that should emphasize the correct layout now.

674
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,800
And if you go down, this should instead not be plural.

675
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,600
So we're going to save that and we should be able to see the notifications

676
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,200
with that little bell icon that says that you have.

677
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,520
Now, from here, we're just going to give this a comment, say.

678
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,080
Sign in buttons.

679
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,040
So this is where we're going to have authentication.

680
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,520
We're going to have some kind of user information.

681
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,400
This will be where a clerk is going to exist.

682
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,680
But we're going to come to that when we talk about authentication.

683
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,400
All right, next part, we're going to create the main part of the landing page.

684
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,080
So this right here with a little bit of carousel to make it look OK.

685
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,760
And then we have search for courses as well, the courses that pop up here.

686
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,360
So if I refresh the page, you can see some animation of the skeleton

687
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,520
and some nice little other design aspects to it.

688
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,760
So let's get started with that.

689
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,360
So going back to our page component, we're going to add another section

690
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,320
and we're going to call this main with class name,

691
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,240
with non-dashboard layout double underscore main like so.

692
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,160
And inside here, we're going to create a landing component.

693
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,680
I'm going to import it, even though we haven't created it just yet.

694
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,840
So I'm going to import landing from at slash app slash friends,

695
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,520
non-dashboard friends slash landing slash page.

696
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,520
Now, this is the path where we're going to put our landing file.

697
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,880
So we're going to create a new folder.

698
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,800
We're going to call this friends non-dashboard and I'll explain why.

699
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,760
The reason why we have this parents is so that it is not included in the path of the URL.

700
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,520
So anytime you use parents inside the app directory,

701
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,280
it's not going to be included when you go to that URL.

702
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,840
So if I instead create a folder inside here, I'm going to call this landing.

703
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,400
And if I create a file called page dot TSX,

704
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,800
that means from the home route at localhost slash landing.

705
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,560
This will be the page that shows it excludes the non-dashboard URL.

706
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:38,320
But also because we have it, we have this landing page over here.

707
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,400
This is also going to show at the home route.

708
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,520
So this exact page will be on landing and this home route.

709
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,240
So we'll have both of those shown.

710
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,160
So from here in our component, I'm going to write RFC.

711
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,600
And we are going to call this landing component like so.

712
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,200
And we aren't seeing anything because we have this linting error.

713
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,920
So we're going to say landing and also, and it seems like I needed to refresh the page.

714
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,480
So now you'll see the landing text over here.

715
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,000
So from here, I'm going to use animation.

716
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,640
So I'm going to do motion dot div like so.

717
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,560
So motion dot div is from framer motion.

718
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:31,280
So we're going to import motion, not morsion, motion from framer dash motion.

719
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,400
So this is a little bit of an animation library.

720
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,520
We're going to make sure we have motion dot div like that.

721
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:44,720
And inside here, we're going to start with an initial opacity of zero.

722
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,280
So this is the initial state of our animation.

723
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,240
And we are going to animate it in with an opacity of one.

724
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,680
So that means it fades in.

725
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,240
We also need to set the time in which it animates.

726
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,760
So we're going to use transition property, give it a duration of 0.5.

727
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,800
And we're going to give it the class name of landing like so.

728
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,400
So if you save it, you're still going to see this error.

729
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,040
I'm not exactly sure why it doesn't show you the right error.

730
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
Seems like a Next.js problem.

731
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,400
But we want to use use client over here.

732
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,360
So now, as you can see, the landing kind of fades in, which is very nice.

733
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,960
From here, we're going to add another motion dot div.

734
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,000
And we're just going to copy this entire animation set properties like this.

735
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,560
I'm sure we close it, but we're going to change a few things.

736
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,640
This time, we actually want things to move.

737
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,200
So we're going to give it a Y of 20.

738
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,720
So it initially starts from position 20 above.

739
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,000
And we want to not do that.

740
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,280
But we start animating to the zero position.

741
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,680
And we should actually put this to be landing double score under hero.

742
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,800
So now if you see that there is a little bit of movement going up into this animation.

743
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,080
And then from here, we're going to do a div with the class name of landing

744
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,440
double underscore hero dash content.

745
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:33,680
Inside here, we're going to do an H1 tag with the class name of landing double underscore title.

746
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:42,880
With the courses and with the P tag with class name of landing double underscore description.

747
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,360
Like so I can just write it out correctly.

748
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:54,400
And this is a list of the courses you can enroll in.

749
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,360
And we're just going to write a little break point.

750
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,280
And we're going to say courses when you need them and want them.

751
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,400
Just some random text.

752
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,720
So we have this over here.

753
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,440
We also need the call to action.

754
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,320
So we're going to say div with the class name of landing double underscore CTA.

755
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,920
And we're going to pass in a link with the href slash search.

756
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,760
And inside here, this will be basically the button that we have.

757
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,240
It'll take us to the search page.

758
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,680
And we're going to give it a class name of landing double underscore CTA dash button.

759
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,920
And we're just going to say search for courses.

760
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,480
And we need to make sure we import the link.

761
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,200
So we're just going to use IntelliSense to do that.

762
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,560
So make sure you grab the next link, not the Lucide React one.

763
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,400
And we should see we have a search for courses button.

764
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,480
And then from here, we're going to create a div.

765
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,040
We're going to call this class name with this.

766
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,920
And we're going to give it a landing double underscore hero dash images.

767
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,640
Close this div out.

768
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:18,400
And inside here, I'm going to put an array to slash hero1.jpg, comma, slash hero2.jpg like so.

769
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,280
Slash hero3.jpg like this.

770
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
So this will represent the little carousel image that we saw.

771
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,000
And we're going to pass in source, comma, index.

772
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,320
And we are going to return.

773
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:40,640
And we're going to grab the image from next image.

774
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,080
We're going to give it a key of source.

775
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,040
Give it a source of source as well for the image.

776
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,680
We're going to do alt.

777
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,080
And we're going to call this hero banner.

778
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,760
This is just a description of what the image will look like.

779
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,240
We're going to do index plus one.

780
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,080
So this is a very unique alt for each one.

781
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,160
We're going to give it a fill property with priority.

782
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,600
And what we want to do is index.

783
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,080
And we're going to set this to current image.

784
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,720
Now, we haven't created current image property.

785
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,360
So let me just close this image tag out.

786
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,520
And we're going to go up and set up a little bit of a hook that will

787
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,760
set up our interval in which the image timing will happen.

788
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
So I'm going to go up here right above the return.

789
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,120
I'm going to call this const current image.

790
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,200
And we're going to do use carousel, which we have not created.

791
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,160
And we're going to put total images of three.

792
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,000
So this little hook is just going to be used so that we can cycle between our images.

793
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,840
So I'm going to go over here, go to our hooks folder that has been created earlier.

794
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,280
I'm going to create a new file.

795
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,200
I'm going to call this use carousel.ts.

796
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:17,840
Inside here, I'm going to import use state, use effect from react.

797
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,760
Like so.

798
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:26,640
And we're going to create an interface because we need some props that we need to pass

799
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
into this component.

800
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:37,360
We're going to say total images will be number with an interval, which is optional.

801
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,560
With a number like this.

802
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,760
From here, I'm going to do export const use carousel.

803
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:55,440
Pass an array or object basically with total images and an interval with the default of

804
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,240
5000.

805
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,120
So five seconds.

806
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,240
And we are going to pass in the use carousel props that we just created.

807
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,360
Create an arrow function.

808
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,520
And we are going to pass in a state with current image.

809
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,000
Set current image.

810
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,240
And we're going to do use state of zero.

811
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,520
So we're going to start with the first image, which is zero index.

812
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,080
And then we're going to create a use effect that will cycle between those images.

813
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,720
So what we do is we're going to create a timer.

814
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,800
We're going to set interval.

815
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:38,240
So this will allow us to cycle between images based on the timer of every few seconds.

816
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,880
We're going to do set current image.

817
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,160
We're going to grab the previous.

818
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,080
Make sure we do.

819
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:51,680
The previous number, which in this first case would be zero.

820
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,520
We're going to add one.

821
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,720
And then we're going to modulus total images like so.

822
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,560
And we're going to pass in interval time over here.

823
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,640
And we're going to make sure we return an arrow function with clear interval and timer.

824
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:20,160
And with the bracket of total images for interval.

825
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,200
So it'll cycle to any time these changes.

826
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,480
And then finally, we're going to return the current image.

827
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,960
So this is a very clean way so that we can grab the current image and it'll cycle through.

828
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,760
Each period, each time based on an interval.

829
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,000
So it just gives us a number cycled every five seconds.

830
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,640
And we're going to go back to our landing page, import that hook that we just created.

831
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,920
And we can go to our image over here.

832
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,120
And we now have the current image.

833
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,880
We still need to add a few things.

834
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:06,560
So sizes is basically a way for us to optimize our images based on the screen size.

835
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,640
And this is provided specifically for Next.js.

836
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,160
But you can also do this with plain old CSS.

837
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,000
It's just a different way of adding it.

838
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,560
So we're going to do a max width of 1200 pixel.

839
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:26,000
We're going to do 50 viewport width and then 33 viewport width.

840
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,280
So this basically is a responsive design of how the resolution of the image should be

841
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,160
based on the size of the screen.

842
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,120
So it's a more image optimization technique.

843
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,680
And then we have class name.

844
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,600
We should also set this to be landing double underscore hero dash image.

845
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:53,840
But we're going to have a conditional situation where if the index is equal to

846
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:05,120
the current image, we're going to set this landing double underscore hero image to be active.

847
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,680
So this is the way that it shows the correct image at the correct time.

848
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,520
And once we have saved that, we can now see that we have an image.

849
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,960
And it cycles through every five seconds.

850
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,040
Nothing too crazy.

851
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:27,600
And then from here, right below the motion.div, but in the other motion div, we're going to

852
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,480
create another one.

853
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,760
Motion.div.

854
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,240
Like so.

855
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,760
Close this out.

856
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,240
And we're going to copy the properties once again.

857
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,520
So we'll have to rewrite it.

858
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,520
Paste it over here.

859
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,720
Now the opacity should be zero.

860
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,680
Y is 20.

861
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,040
So this is all fine.

862
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,040
But this time we're going to add a viewport element.

863
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:57,360
This should be amount of 0.3 and wants to be true.

864
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:03,840
So these two properties determine when it gets animated.

865
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,000
And this means that it will only do it once.

866
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,160
The animation should only happen once, right when you enter that viewing section of the

867
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,660
page.

868
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:21,920
And now when we do it like this, the animate property needs to be while in view instead.

869
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,040
Instead of the landing double score hero, this should be featured instead.

870
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:34,080
And below this is where I'm going to add the tags.

871
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,880
So we're going to start with an h2 header tag.

872
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,080
And we're going to do class name of landing double underscore featured dash title.

873
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,760
Close this out.

874
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,360
We're going to say featured courses.

875
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,120
And below this, I'm going to have a p tag.

876
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:57,520
We're going to say class name is equal to landing double underscore featured dash description.

877
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,520
Save it just so you can see.

878
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,440
In here, I'm just going to have a bunch of text.

879
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,520
So I'm going to say from beginner to advanced.

880
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,560
In all industries, we have the right courses just for you.

881
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:24,480
And preparing your entire journey for learning and making the most.

882
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,920
A bunch of gibberish, whatever.

883
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,440
You can change that text to whatever you want.

884
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,560
And then right below that, we are going to have some tags.

885
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:39,520
So we're going to say class name, we're going to landing double underscore tags like so.

886
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,880
Put this in brackets.

887
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,400
I'm going to say web development like so.

888
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,920
Enterprise IT.

889
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,760
React Next JS.

890
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,720
Web development.

891
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,560
And enterprise IT.

892
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,760
Now, usually I would spend the time to make it more relevant.

893
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,560
But for now, we're just going to have a bunch of these text.

894
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,680
We're going to map this out.

895
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,760
Give it the tag text with index.

896
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,640
Close this out with the span.

897
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:26,960
Give it a key of index with the class name of landing double underscore tag.

898
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,320
Close this.

899
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,040
Pass in the tag element.

900
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,800
And we'll see that we have our tags like this.

901
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,560
It looks kind of bad that we just have duplicate values.

902
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:45,680
So I'm going to just change this to be back end development, something like this.

903
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,320
So it looks a little bit different.

904
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:48,820
There we go.

905
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:55,600
And then the final part of this page is going to include the actual courses.

906
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,120
Now, this course is going to come from our back end.

907
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,760
So right now, what we're going to do, I'm going to pass in a div.

908
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,440
Call this class name of landing double underscore courses.

909
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:16,800
But for now, we're going to add a comment courses display over here.

910
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:22,000
And the reason why we're going to do this is because we need to do the back end first.

911
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,960
And we're going to create the courses back end API endpoint to fetch this data.

912
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,400
Actually, before we do that, I just want to do one more thing.

913
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,280
It's if you refresh the page, we don't have this loading skeleton like this.

914
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,960
If you see over here, that's the loading skeleton that will show up when the courses page comes in.

915
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,240
So we're just going to create this.

916
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,720
You're probably not going to be able to see it until we grab the courses.

917
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,880
So I'm going to do loading skeleton like so.

918
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,760
And we're going to create this out real quick.

919
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,800
So we're going to return.

920
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,040
There's not much to this.

921
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,360
So we're going to do landing skeleton.

922
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,480
So basically, what we're doing to create this skeleton over here, when you see this,

923
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,560
is basically we need to replicate the entire layout of the page.

924
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,920
But we're just going to replace it with empty object.

925
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,160
Now, this is one of those situations where I would just say, use AI for this,

926
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,240
because this is very tedious.

927
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,120
And the AI is pretty good at doing things like this.

928
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,680
If it's just to replicate something, it's a very convenient tool to do this.

929
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,600
So that's exactly what I did, and it got it right on the first time.

930
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,480
So skeleton double underscore hero dash content.

931
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:44,640
And I'm going to pass in skeleton, which is going to come from our components UI skeleton,

932
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,200
which is from our shadcn library.

933
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:55,360
We're going to grab the class name to landing skeleton double underscore title.

934
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,400
We're going to close this.

935
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,080
And I'm just going to copy this out, paste it four times.

936
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,720
And we're just going to change the class.

937
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,320
So subtitle dash secondary.

938
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,000
This should be button over here.

939
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,920
And then I'm going to paste it one more time.

940
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,600
This should be hero dash image.

941
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,240
So right now, you're not going to be able to see that.

942
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,920
On yours, because we haven't implemented just yet.

943
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:40,240
Below this, I'm going to have a div with the class name of landing skeleton double underscore

944
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,800
featured like so.

945
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,600
And I'm going to paste skeleton two more times.

946
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:51,040
This should be featured dash title.

947
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,880
It should be featured dash description.

948
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:04,080
And below this, we're going to do div with class name of landing dash skeleton underscore

949
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:04,720
tags.

950
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,200
And the reason why we need to replicate the entire thing is so we have the exact same

951
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,960
positioning so that it's nice because you want it to be exactly the same, simply because

952
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,120
it's going to just have the same layout.

953
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,920
So it doesn't cause like a layout shift.

954
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,360
So it's not it's very smooth when you look at the loading.

955
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:35,440
Like if you take a look and I refresh, it's in the exact same positions that it's supposed

956
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,000
to be.

957
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,080
That's why if you take the time to do this, it makes it look all right.

958
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,320
From here, we're going to do a key with an index class name landing skeleton underscore

959
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,600
tag like so.

960
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,880
And I'm going to copy this over here and we're going to do the same thing, except there should

961
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,600
be courses.

962
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,160
There should be only four of these.

963
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,040
And we're going to do course dash card.

964
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,200
And there's that.

965
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,800
So we're just going to keep it like this.

966
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,560
We're going to be using it later on.

967
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,760
So while we put the courses on hold, we're going to go back to our page.

968
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,640
We're just going to finish this up with a further component.

969
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,960
They're going to place this over here.

970
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,400
I'm going to go back to our directory and inside the components folder, I'm going to

971
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,640
create a new file, call this further.

972
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,640
And I'm going to use RFC.

973
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,400
We have their further component already.

974
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,200
And inside here, we're going to have it pretty simple.

975
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,720
I'm just going to say class name is going to be further inside here.

976
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,360
I'm going to put a P tag and we're going to have a symbol of the copyright.

977
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,600
Little at sign.

978
01:05:51,600 --> 01:06:02,480
So that's going to be and copy semicolon 2024 at row all rights reserved like so.

979
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,040
Passing our div with class name.

980
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,520
With further double underscore links like so passing our div curly braces, I'm going

981
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:36,000
to say about privacy policy, licensing contact, and I'm going to do dot map pass in item and

982
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,960
return an arrow function.

983
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:47,200
And I'm going to pass in a link from next link like so say key is equal to item.

984
01:06:47,200 --> 01:07:02,720
Each ref is going to be slash item dot to lower case, perens dot replace any spaces

985
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,880
with dashes class name.

986
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:11,760
By the way, these links will go anywhere, but if you wanted to, you can add these links

987
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,280
to be legitimate.

988
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,720
And we're going to pass an item over here.

989
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,400
Save that.

990
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:26,560
And over here, we're going to go back to our main page, import further from at components

991
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,060
further.

992
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:31,840
And you should be able to see that we have our further over here.

993
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,140
Perfect.

994
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,320
For us to grab information about the courses, we need to turn our attention to the back

995
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:38,800
end.

996
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:44,160
And when we turn our attention to the back end, we need to focus on the database and

997
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,840
how our data is structured.

998
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:53,120
This part, also known as data modeling, is a very, very important part of your application.

999
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:59,040
And some people don't even do this step, but it is extremely important because the way

1000
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,440
you structure your data affects your entire application.

1001
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,120
It is the foundation.

1002
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,440
It is the very root foundation of your entire application.

1003
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,920
So if you structure your data in a very poor way, it will affect how messy your application

1004
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,800
will become.

1005
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,960
Everything else will become messy and become hard to work with.

1006
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,920
All these other applications, all these YouTube tutorials where you're building an application,

1007
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:32,880
but they're using managed back ends and managed databases such as app right or a convex

1008
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,920
databases, which are, you know, I'm not knocking on them.

1009
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:36,400
They're great.

1010
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,880
They're great tools for what they're supposed to do, which is manage your back end, manage

1011
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,840
your database.

1012
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:48,000
But I will say for you as a developer, doing those type of databases is not good for your

1013
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,560
future as a software engineer.

1014
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,080
Now, I know there's a lot of videos out there.

1015
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,200
You guys are learning all these new front end technologies like Svelte and then on the

1016
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,960
back end, Hano, Express.

1017
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,440
I will say, I will say this is my honest opinion.

1018
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,680
You are almost wasting your time trying to learn the latest technology, especially in

1019
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,160
front end.

1020
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:18,480
There is a point, there is a cap on how much people believe your ability as a software

1021
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,400
engineer is if all you know is front end engineering.

1022
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:26,560
It is a sad truth of the harsh job market.

1023
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,480
And it's simply because demand, right?

1024
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,680
Supply and demand.

1025
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,600
There is an extremely large amount of front end engineers.

1026
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:42,640
There's so many front end engineers who are just building CRUD applications, doing front

1027
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,760
end, just styling and designing a website.

1028
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:54,080
But I will tell you, it is a very, it is a losing, it is a losing proposition to go against

1029
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:59,040
AI, which is specifically targeting front end much more than back end right now.

1030
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:05,280
It is affecting both, but front end engineers are getting more clobbered by AI.

1031
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,800
Even people who are non-technical, they're starting to build websites with AI.

1032
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
They're just telling AI to do it.

1033
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,720
And they're going to think, why, if I can do this, why would I pay someone to build

1034
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,480
these applications for me?

1035
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:25,840
Now, you might think that they would do the same thing with back end and DevOps.

1036
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,560
And as someone who's been doing that for quite some time now, I can tell you it is

1037
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,800
a lot harder for them to grasp the right ways to do back end and DevOps, because there are

1038
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:43,040
a lot more decisions that are higher level that require a lot more planning that affects

1039
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:48,320
the downstream effects and scalability that is harder for AI to cover that.

1040
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,000
So I encourage you guys, you probably know enough React, you probably know enough front

1041
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,240
end and using something like a managed back end and managed database, a convex database

1042
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,360
app, which have their purposes and have their use case of building fast MVPs.

1043
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,520
It is not useful for you as a developer to learn those technologies because back end

1044
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,760
and DevOps is going to be where you can stand out.

1045
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,360
And as someone who's been hiring developers nowadays to help me out on task, I can tell

1046
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,640
you the supply of front end developers is almost overwhelming.

1047
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,680
There are people who would do it for pennies versus back end engineers, which are a lot

1048
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,960
harder to find.

1049
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,320
Anyways, you don't have to take my word for it.

1050
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,760
It's just my opinion.

1051
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,720
You can give it a shot.

1052
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:45,520
Anyways, so back to our data modeling in our course, we have a number of properties.

1053
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,640
You can think of this as just basically a large object.

1054
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,240
This is how we sort our data.

1055
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,960
So we have our course and we have a lot of these properties that are going to be sorted

1056
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
into this basic course.

1057
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,480
And it's also going to have nested objects in this case.

1058
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,320
So we're going to have section, chapters and comments.

1059
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,800
So sections just categorize a group of chapters and chapters are where we're going to actually

1060
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,200
have the video URL stored.

1061
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,480
We're also going to have transaction and user course progress schemas that are going to

1062
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,280
include a number of properties, but I'll come to those when we talk about it.

1063
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,320
But for now, know that in this particular data model, we're storing all our information

1064
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:36,080
into a single course so that anytime we fetch the course object, we grab all the properties

1065
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,680
relevant to the course in one API call, in one fell swoop from our database.

1066
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,480
However, we do not store the progress of the user because you know how the user watches

1067
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,640
a video, they are progressing through and we need to save information on how far they

1068
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:59,600
have gotten in that course, whether they completed a certain section or a chapter.

1069
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,440
That is where the user course progress is aligned.

1070
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,920
Now, when it comes to data modeling, these are high level decisions.

1071
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:15,760
You could put the user course progress in this course object, but the problem is sometimes

1072
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,480
with the user course progress, this becomes way too dense.

1073
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:25,520
There is too much data in the same object and that is a problem.

1074
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,720
This is why we have to spend the time to model out data structures like this.

1075
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:37,680
So for example, in the user course progress, if we put this into the course object, that

1076
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:46,160
means the user course progress concludes information about a single user, about a single

1077
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,200
course and how much progress they have made.

1078
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:55,840
But the problem with that is in that same course, if we had thousands of users that

1079
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,440
are applied to the same course, this object would become massive.

1080
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,000
That means when you fetch the data, it's going to become a massive object of too much

1081
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,800
information, which is, you know, if you use DynamoDB, it has limits of how much each item

1082
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,480
in the database can hold.

1083
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,320
So for every course object, it's going to be too much information.

1084
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:26,480
That is exactly why we separated the user course progress, which is just specifically

1085
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,200
how much they've gone through in each course.

1086
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,120
And we'll go more into detail of how we structure.

1087
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:40,560
But before we go further, let me explain the decision on choosing DynamoDB as the database.

1088
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,240
Because some of you have been requesting me to go through some system design ideas.

1089
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:52,000
So we're going to talk about why DynamoDB was chosen for this particular application.

1090
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,080
And when you choose any database, the first thing you want to ask is whether you choose

1091
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,400
SQL versus NoSQL.

1092
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,600
Now, in this case, as you can see, we have three different schemas, which is actually

1093
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,640
not that many.

1094
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,640
This is a pretty low amount of tables that you would need for an application.

1095
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,240
And there isn't that many relationships.

1096
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:21,600
You might have a course and there might be transactions that involve the course.

1097
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,880
So transactions are related to course in that kind of way.

1098
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,360
Same thing with the user course progress.

1099
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,200
It is related to the course ID.

1100
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,360
But in short, this is not that many relationships.

1101
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,200
When you have a social media application where you have a post and every post might have

1102
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:47,200
users both liking and commenting, that can spiral out of control in a number of relationships.

1103
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:55,200
Those require SQL type databases because you want to be able to fetch all of those in one

1104
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:55,700
go.

1105
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,960
In this case, when we grab a course, we just need the course information.

1106
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,880
And then sometimes we might want transaction information in another separate API call because

1107
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,400
we're calling them separately.

1108
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,280
We don't need that many relationships.

1109
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:20,400
That is exactly why DynamoDB is the NoSQL choice that we're going to use because we

1110
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,080
don't need that many relationships.

1111
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,920
And SQL does, it brings ACID guarantees.

1112
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:28,720
You can look that up.

1113
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:34,160
I'm not going to go into it, which basically means like it's more secure and more consistent.

1114
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,680
But it also becomes with a lot of overhead maintenance.

1115
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:44,000
So sometimes you want to avoid those because you want scalability and speed, which is NoSQL's

1116
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,640
strong point.

1117
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:52,880
So once we have decided that we aren't going to use SQL, then we can decide using DynamoDB

1118
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,240
versus other NoSQL.

1119
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,480
And DynamoDB is very fast and performant.

1120
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,520
And it's going to scale on its own.

1121
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,080
So you don't have to worry about doing all the scaling.

1122
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,520
You don't have to worry about managing your database in that kind of way.

1123
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,640
AWS handles it for you.

1124
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,400
So you don't even have to worry about that.

1125
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:19,600
Even if you compare it to something like MongoDB, which you probably have heard, DynamoDB is

1126
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,760
even better because it's already all managed.

1127
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,560
You don't have to worry about much of the infrastructure.

1128
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,720
It's going to scale automatically just for you.

1129
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,920
You don't have to worry about that.

1130
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,160
And there's no networking issues.

1131
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,840
If you saw my other videos where I'm dealing with networking, there's not that many networking

1132
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,480
things that you need to deal with when you're using DynamoDB.

1133
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,160
And especially when you're using the AWS ecosystem, this is ideal.

1134
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,400
And also DynamoDB is very cheap.

1135
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,560
There is a free tour and it's always going to be free.

1136
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,720
You don't even have to have a free tier account.

1137
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:00,240
It's going to have a very generous free tier that's going to always be available, especially

1138
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,200
for you as a developer.

1139
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,480
This is important for me to make this decision because you guys would not be willing to pay

1140
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:13,360
for hosting on some paid server just for your own, you know, like dev projects.

1141
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:18,800
Now, I have listed some disadvantages, which I've already covered.

1142
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,360
It's not ideal for tables with many relationships.

1143
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,920
It's not great for highly nested data structures.

1144
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,800
And I'll come to the course later on when we have sections and chapters, which becomes

1145
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,120
a little bit of an issue because it's quite nested.

1146
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,080
It's not very nice.

1147
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:39,120
And DynamoDB is not good for filtering, sorting and aggregation.

1148
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,800
If you have like a table and you need complex filtering needs of all your data, those are

1149
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,560
situations where, you know, no SQL in general is not good.

1150
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,120
MongoDB is better at filtering than DynamoDB.

1151
01:18:53,120 --> 01:19:02,720
DynamoDB is much more fast and performant in skills, but it is even worse than MongoDB

1152
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,480
and DocumentDB of complex filtering and sorting.

1153
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,120
So just be aware of DynamoDB.

1154
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:14,640
DynamoDB excels more so than MongoDB if you have less tables.

1155
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,320
Ideally, you have less tables.

1156
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:21,760
And there used to be a period where people would just go extreme with DynamoDB and they

1157
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,400
would do a single table for their entire data.

1158
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,520
Nowadays, it's almost frowned upon.

1159
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,640
You should only use the tables that you need, but you shouldn't force one table.

1160
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,840
But that's a story for another day.

1161
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,080
That's that.

1162
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,520
Anyways, I know I've been talking for a long time for this backend and database.

1163
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,920
Now, let me know in the comments section if you like what I'm doing with explaining a

1164
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,920
lot more, because sometimes it's just a lot of talking when you talk about the decision

1165
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,600
making behind something like this, because there's a lot of, you know, I can't really

1166
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,400
do this live.

1167
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,040
It's kind of a process where you just have to kind of consider a lot of different things.

1168
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,440
And so it just ends up being about talking.

1169
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,840
So let me know in the comments whether you like it or not.

1170
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,200
All right, so enough talking.

1171
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,200
Let's go and download DynamoDB.

1172
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:15,440
Now, DynamoDB is hosted on AWS, but we're going to be using the DynamoDB local so that

1173
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:20,320
we can make sure everything works locally before we deploy everything onto AWS.

1174
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:27,440
So go to the link in the description and you can go to this page, deploying DynamoDB locally

1175
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,160
on your computer.

1176
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:33,280
Now, before we do this, you may or may not have the Java runtime.

1177
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,960
So you also want to download Java if you need to, which you go over here and you can install

1178
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,040
based on your operating system.

1179
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:47,040
Once you have that installed, I'm not going to go through that process, but I will go

1180
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,880
through the process of downloading DynamoDB local over here.

1181
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,160
So you can see right here, I'm going to choose zip.

1182
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,760
Save that.

1183
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,560
Once we have downloaded that, we're going to open up our directory.

1184
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,120
I'm going to extract it.

1185
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:11,120
I'm going to call this DynamoDB-local like this.

1186
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:19,120
And if you go back to the link, you can see that we have this particular URL.

1187
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:24,800
So now you can open a command prompt and navigate to the directory, but we're just going to

1188
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,880
use absolute entire path.

1189
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to get info in Mac.

1190
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,080
You can do the same thing equivalent in Windows.

1191
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,240
I'm going to just copy as path name for this.

1192
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:49,040
So the command for this is going to be java-djava.library.path is equal to.

1193
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:58,160
I'm going to paste the path that we had and I'm going to write DynamoDB-local, which

1194
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:02,320
represent this folder right here, and I want the path to DynamoDB-local_lib.

1195
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,960
So I'm going to do DynamoDB-local_lib.

1196
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:17,520
So that gets the path of the library and we want to write jar as well, but this one is

1197
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:22,080
going to be the path to the jar file right here.

1198
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:36,320
So I'm going to do the same thing, DynamoDB-local/DynamoDB-local.jar and we are going to do shared DB.

1199
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:44,000
And I believe this should be lowercase b like that.

1200
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,240
Yeah.

1201
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:50,160
So let me close this out one more time so you can see the actual full path right here

1202
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:55,040
is the path to the library file and this is the path to the jar file.

1203
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,520
So that comes with the download that we have.

1204
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,840
So once you have this correct, when you press enter, you're going to see you have DynamoDB-local

1205
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,440
with the following configuration.

1206
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,480
So this is the port.

1207
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,800
So that's how simple it is to run DynamoDB.

1208
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,840
And then with this, we can run commands to execute on the DynamoDB.

1209
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:22,960
Now, if you want to access DynamoDB programmatically, you're going to need the AWS CLI.

1210
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,440
Now, in another link, I know there's a lot to install, but this is AWS.

1211
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,480
So you have a lot of things, a lot of moving pieces.

1212
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,560
So AWS CLI is pretty easy and simple to install.

1213
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:41,280
You go to this link and you just go to your particular OS and install the package over

1214
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,600
here and follow the instructions.

1215
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,160
And most of this is just you download the file, it's going to run an installer, go through

1216
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,840
the commands, and then you just have to make sure it's working AWS-version.

1217
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,280
Should be pretty straightforward.

1218
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:03,200
And over here, I'm going to open up a new window and I've already done this, so I'm

1219
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,160
not going to configure it, but there is a command.

1220
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:11,760
Once you have AWS installed, the CLI, you're going to run AWS configure.

1221
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,360
You're going to see AWS access key.

1222
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,640
This is where you're going to put your access key, secret key.

1223
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,720
Now, you don't have to do it right now.

1224
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,120
We will configure this later if we need to on AWS account.

1225
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,840
But for now, you don't really need to do so.

1226
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,880
You can just add fake keys.

1227
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:36,160
Like, for example, they just said fake my key ID, secret key access.

1228
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,680
So you don't need to do anything.

1229
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,640
You just put these fake values and should be enough to work.

1230
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:45,840
And once you have done that, we can just grab this link over here.

1231
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,080
Let me just cancel this out.

1232
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:53,280
If I paste it over here, we should be able to get table names.

1233
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:59,840
So right now, we have nothing in our table for our database, but we are basically calling

1234
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,640
our endpoint, which is at port 8000.

1235
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:07,200
So it should be working and you should be able to see an empty array right here.

1236
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,920
So that's pretty much all you need for running DynamoDB locally.

1237
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,240
OK, there's one more thing I want to show you in regards to this.

1238
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,240
So right now, this path right here is what is running our server.

1239
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,280
So I cancel it out.

1240
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,440
I just wanted to show you the path one more time.

1241
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:30,880
But anytime we close the database, we're going to lose all the data that we stored in our

1242
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,920
local database.

1243
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:32,800
We don't want that.

1244
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,320
We want our data to persist.

1245
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,920
So if we reopen it again, we have our information.

1246
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,400
So we just add another configuration.

1247
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,480
We write DB path.

1248
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:47,280
And what we want is the path to our current folder.

1249
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:54,480
So this is where my directory is saving or this is where my code base basically is.

1250
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,000
So right now, this is what I want to be stored.

1251
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,920
So if I want to do, I can grab this as path name.

1252
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,000
I'm going to paste that, write run.

1253
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,760
And when you run it, it's going to do the same exact thing that we did.

1254
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:18,400
But when we store our data into our DynamoDB table, it's going to save information or persisted

1255
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,240
data into this particular folder path.

1256
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,360
All right.

1257
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,120
So from here, there's one last thing that we can install.

1258
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,200
I know there's quite a bit of things that are coming along.

1259
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,080
It's a lot of setup.

1260
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,960
But this part is optional if you want to see.

1261
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,800
So what I want you to do is go to this NoSQL Workbench for DynamoDB.

1262
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:47,600
This will allow us to see the database in a visual UI and table desktop application.

1263
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,640
So you can install this, run the instructions.

1264
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,600
It's pretty simple.

1265
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,600
In this case, we have everything installed.

1266
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:59,680
Once you have that installed, you can open up NoSQL Workbench.

1267
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:03,680
Now, the main thing you just want to take a look at, you can ignore everything.

1268
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,800
You just have to look at Operation Builder.

1269
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,400
I already have these connections.

1270
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,520
I'm just going to delete them so I can redo it.

1271
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,080
What you want to do is see Operation Builder.

1272
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,840
You go to Add Connection.

1273
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,120
And you want to select DynamoDB Local.

1274
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,120
Right now, it's not going to work.

1275
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,160
Once we set up our database, we're going to come back to this.

1276
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,320
We're going to hit Connect when we're ready.

1277
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:31,280
And it's going to show us the data that we have in our database.

1278
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,840
We just don't have our backend set up, so it's not going to work yet.

1279
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:36,160
All right.

1280
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,160
So that's probably more setup that you probably don't want to do.

1281
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,920
So we can finally, finally go back to our backend.

1282
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,560
Now, as you can see, we actually have the database.

1283
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,600
There's nothing stored in here right now.

1284
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,240
But that is where we did a database path.

1285
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,760
That's how we can use that.

1286
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,800
So now we can finally, finally write our code for the backend.

1287
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,960
So I'm going to create a new folder.

1288
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,880
And I'm going to call this server.

1289
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,120
And then from here, I'm going to open up our terminal.

1290
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:13,360
I'm going to close out the terminal, go to our parent directory via cd --.

1291
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,480
And I'm going to do cd server like so.

1292
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:21,680
Inside here, I'm going to do npm init -y.

1293
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,520
So we set up our package JSON.

1294
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,200
And I'm going to install a number of packages.

1295
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:36,240
So I'm going to do npm i @awsstk/client-dynamoDB.

1296
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,160
So this allows us to access AWS SDK and DynamoDB.

1297
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:48,560
I'm also going to install AWS SDK body parser to parse our request for Express.

1298
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,760
And then we're also going to install Express.

1299
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,040
And then cores.env for environment variables.

1300
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,240
Helmet for a little bit of security.

1301
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:04,720
Morgan for logging our backend API calls.

1302
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,960
Dynamoose for DynamoDB style.

1303
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,040
It makes it -- it's kind of like Mongoose if you ever use MongoDB.

1304
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,480
Provides an easy way to validate your database.

1305
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:20,320
And UUID for unique IDs.

1306
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:25,200
And then from there, we're going to install a number of dev dependencies.

1307
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,520
So npm i -D.

1308
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,600
We're going to do rim ref.

1309
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:35,040
This will allow us to run a few things simultaneously for our scripts.

1310
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,600
Same thing with concurrently.

1311
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,960
Nodemon for a development server.

1312
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,120
So it automatically updates.

1313
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,000
ts node for TypeScript.

1314
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,920
Then TypeScript itself.

1315
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:54,240
And then a number of types, which is going to be @types/cores.

1316
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,280
@types/express.

1317
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,480
@types/morgan.

1318
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,120
@types/node.

1319
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,160
@types/uuid.

1320
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:10,640
Then from here in our server directory, we're going to create a new folder.

1321
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,240
We're going to call this source.

1322
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,120
This is where all our code files will exist.

1323
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,280
And I'm going to create a new file.

1324
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,680
Call this index.ts.

1325
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:27,440
We're going to import a number of things that we already installed.

1326
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,120
So express from express like so.

1327
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:36,480
Import .env from .env like this.

1328
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:41,760
Import body parser from body parser.

1329
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:47,760
Import cores from cores.

1330
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:54,480
Import helmet from helmet.

1331
01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:02,320
Import morgan from morgan like that.

1332
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:11,120
And then import star, meaning everything, as dynamos from dynamos like so.

1333
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:18,080
And then we're going to leave a comment saying route imports.

1334
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,440
So I accidentally hit a hotkey.

1335
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,280
Don't worry about that.

1336
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,920
And then I'm going to add configurations.

1337
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,800
And this is where we're going to have all the middleware set up.

1338
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,200
So .env.config.

1339
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,680
And from here, I'm going to set is production.

1340
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:43,680
And we're going to set an environment variable called process.env.node_env.

1341
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,400
And we're going to say that is equal to production.

1342
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,680
We're going to keep it like that.

1343
01:31:51,680 --> 01:32:04,960
And I'm just going to say if is production, then we're going to say dynamos.aws.ddb.local.

1344
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,120
So this is just basically set up our dynamos.

1345
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:13,600
And this is all we need to do if you want to use the local dynamos database.

1346
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Once we have that, we can set up our other middleware.

1347
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,360
So our express.

1348
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:26,160
And then we're going to do app.use with express.json.

1349
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,680
And then app.use_helmet.

1350
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,480
If I can spell that correctly.

1351
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:43,120
App.use_helmet.crossorigin resource_policy.

1352
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:49,520
Put the policy colon cross dash origin.

1353
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:55,600
App.use Morgan and put common as well.

1354
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,280
App.use.

1355
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,720
Now typically, you would normally just like copy this.

1356
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:08,640
Or you can use AI to like make the code writing faster.

1357
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,760
That's what I would use.

1358
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,160
But I'm just writing this out just for you guys.

1359
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,600
Because I know you guys like just following along sometimes.

1360
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,080
So body parser.url encoded.

1361
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,600
We're going to put extended colon false.

1362
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:30,400
And then app.use_cores like so.

1363
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:36,320
And then from here, I'm going to set up routes and say app.get/recres.

1364
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,920
And we just use this particular route as home route.

1365
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,240
So we can just check if everything is working.

1366
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:46,640
And I'm just going to say hello world.

1367
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:51,280
And I'm going to create our server as well.

1368
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:59,680
And I'm going to say port is equal to process.env.port will be 3000 like so.

1369
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:06,240
And if it is, I'm going to say port is equal to process.env.port.

1370
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,760
Not production basically.

1371
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:15,600
So if it's local, we're going to do app.listen to our port.

1372
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,200
We're going to make sure everything runs.

1373
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:26,880
We're going to say console.log server running on port with the port variable.

1374
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,800
And I did make a mistake up here.

1375
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,360
This should be exclamation.

1376
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,440
So it's not production as well right there.

1377
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,360
So there you go.

1378
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,720
And then we also need to set up the environment variables.

1379
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,760
So I'm going to create a new file, call this .env.

1380
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,440
And we are going to set up a number of ports.

1381
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:51,280
We're going to do port 8001 because our database is running on port 8000.

1382
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:59,360
And then I'm going to also set up an environment variable, node_env_development like so.

1383
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,760
With that, we have most of our back end set up.

1384
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
But we're going to go to our package.json.

1385
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:11,120
Inside the package.json, I'm going to get rid of the test script.

1386
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:12,560
We're going to write a build script.

1387
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:19,600
We're going to use rimref, dist, and npx-tsc.

1388
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:27,200
By the way, the reason why we use rimref, which is just a way to make easy to delete

1389
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:31,760
directories and also their contents like everything in that folder recursively.

1390
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,840
And this is cross-platform compatible.

1391
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,360
So for Windows and Mac, it will delete the folder dist and run TypeScript.

1392
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:44,960
And the way our folder structure will be set up is that our source directory is going to

1393
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,800
include all our TypeScript files.

1394
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:52,880
But because we don't use, we're not using like webpack with Next.js, which automatically

1395
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,760
handles all of this TypeScript compilation into JavaScript, we have to kind of set this

1396
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,880
up ourselves.

1397
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:05,280
So what we do is basically we're writing a script that will take all our TypeScript

1398
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:11,760
files in our source directory, create a folder called dist that will include all the files

1399
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,480
that we have from TypeScript, but into JavaScript.

1400
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:20,880
So this needs to, anytime we build it, we need to remove everything from the dist folder.

1401
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,040
And then we run npx-tsc.

1402
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,600
So that is compiling our TypeScript.

1403
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:32,720
And then as we continue along, we're going to write all the commands that are necessary.

1404
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:37,120
So the first thing we want to do is have a command for start.

1405
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:44,880
So we do npm run build and node dist/index.js.

1406
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,880
So anytime we want to actually run our server, we're going to build it.

1407
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:55,520
So run this command and then we run node dist index.js because there's going to be a folder

1408
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:02,800
called dist and our index.js that got compiled from index.ts will become index.js in our

1409
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,840
dist directory.

1410
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,400
And then we're also going to have a dev script.

1411
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,840
This is going to be very similar.

1412
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:18,480
We're going to do npm run build, but we're going to use concurrently to run our TypeScript

1413
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:18,880
file.

1414
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:35,040
So we're going to do /npx-tsc-w/"/nodemon.

1415
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:45,840
We're going to run double dash execute ts-node source/index.ts/".

1416
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:59,920
It is a little tricky to get these values right, so you can look at the repo and just

1417
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,120
copy it if you need to.

1418
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:06,800
But basically what's happening is we're running tsc, so we're compiling the TypeScript

1419
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:14,000
files, but we're also running nodemon to make sure we watch the source index for any

1420
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:14,640
changes.

1421
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:20,400
So anytime we make changes to our directory, nodemon is going to redevelop the server so

1422
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,920
we don't have to turn off the server and rerun it again just so we get changes.

1423
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,200
So it automatically will watch for changes.

1424
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:34,320
And we're going to have a command called seed.

1425
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:44,400
So we're going to do ts-node source/seed/seed-dynamo-db.typescript.

1426
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:49,280
So basically this will run our seed script from our Dynamo database.

1427
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:53,200
And if you remember, we have our asset download.

1428
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:58,960
We also have our folders for servers that we can pass in.

1429
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,640
And inside this, we're going to have a seed file with seed-dynamo-db.ts.

1430
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:10,320
But before we do that, let's set up the TypeScript file or TypeScript installation.

1431
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:16,560
So we're going to run npx tsc --init in our server directory.

1432
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,840
That will create a tsconfig.json.

1433
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,600
And what we want to do is configure a few things.

1434
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,200
So I'm going to search up module.

1435
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:34,960
And in here, I'm going to change this to node-next.

1436
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,440
I'm going to uncomment module resolution, and that should be node-next as well.

1437
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:47,840
We're going to go to resolve json-module.

1438
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,240
Uncomment this out.

1439
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,080
And then finally, we're going to go to out directory.

1440
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,640
And this should be /dist.

1441
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:59,200
And we're going to go all the way down.

1442
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:07,440
And at the very end, before in between these closing braces, we're going to write include.

1443
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:13,680
We want to make sure we include all these files so we can access all of them.

1444
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:23,440
And then we're going to have source/data**/*.json.

1445
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,040
So we get all the seed files.

1446
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,000
And we're going to leave it like that.

1447
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
All right.

1448
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,480
With that, we have all of that set up.

1449
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,640
Now we can move these folders into our server directory.

1450
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:42,640
So in our source, we're just going to drag all three of these folders into our source directory.

1451
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:46,160
And I will explain what all of these are.

1452
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:54,800
So here in our models directory, this represents each schema that we talked about earlier.

1453
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,680
So if we go back over here, this is the schema of each data model.

1454
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:07,440
And we have one for a course, transaction, user course progress.

1455
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:12,560
And for each of these, we're going to have different schemas as well.

1456
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,560
So this is the main one.

1457
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,360
It basically identifies what we want.

1458
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:22,480
So if teacher_id, if we say it's required true, so that if we want to insert data,

1459
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,360
it's going to force us to put teacher_id.

1460
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:26,880
So we can put required true.

1461
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,560
You can put the different types.

1462
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:37,200
And in the link in the description, you can check out what the documents are saying about

1463
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:37,760
Dynamos.

1464
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,200
It's very similar to Mongoose.

1465
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,440
It has different strings or different, you know, like different types.

1466
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,320
So make sure you look at this if you want some details on it and what's happening.

1467
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,960
But that is basically our models.

1468
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,640
I didn't want to go through it and write this in front of you because it takes kind of

1469
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,080
quite some time.

1470
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,600
But we also have the seed file.

1471
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,520
So seed, we actually need to install Pluralize.

1472
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,120
So I'm just copy that npm pluralize.

1473
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,040
Download that.

1474
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,760
That should make this okay.

1475
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,960
But it does seem like we need to install the dev types.

1476
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:24,880
So you can do npm i --save-dev or capital D if you want, @type/Pluralize.

1477
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,760
And that should take care of this linting error.

1478
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,640
So once you have this, you're going to see this particular page.

1479
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:36,800
And this is going to allow us to seed our database.

1480
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,720
Now, you don't have to worry about everything that's going on.

1481
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,360
But basically what happens is we're going to have a bunch of seed data.

1482
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:50,480
So this is just mock data, just so we can actually look at when we get to our website,

1483
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,480
we have a list of courses, a list of information that we can use on the front end.

1484
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:00,640
And we're just going to seed that into our database so that we don't have to worry about

1485
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:05,680
having fake or, you know, creating the data, make it so that it's easier for development.

1486
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:09,920
So in the seed function, we're just going to delete all the database.

1487
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:14,480
We're just going to create the tables and make sure everything works.

1488
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:20,480
And then finally, we just have a bunch of utils function because this would take too long for me

1489
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,920
to go through every single thing.

1490
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,880
So this will just be a couple functions that are just going to be automatically written.

1491
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,200
And with that, let's try running our server.

1492
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,600
So I'm going to write npm run dev.

1493
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,440
And as you can see, we have our dist folder, which should basically work.

1494
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:39,520
And while we don't have a UI to check this, we can use curl,

1495
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,080
which will allow us to make an API call from the terminal.

1496
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:50,160
And I'm just going to do HTTP colon slash local host colon 8001.

1497
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,560
Open this up so you can see what I'm doing.

1498
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,240
And I'm going to hit enter.

1499
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,840
And what you should receive back is "Hello world!"

1500
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:02,560
And we should be able to see this request, which is from Morgan.

1501
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:11,280
It shows our request, get HTTP 1.1 status 200, meaning it was a successful API call.

1502
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,440
And that is our server in action.

1503
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,600
So that's how you test back in APIs.

1504
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,440
You can use curl, but you can also use a tool called Postman.

1505
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,560
A lot of people like using Postman for testing back in APIs.

1506
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:24,960
I don't personally use it that much, but it's up to you.

1507
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,320
This gives you a very more extensive way to call your back end.

1508
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:33,520
So HTTP slash slash local host colon 8001.

1509
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,840
And you can just hit send to make sure it's a get request.

1510
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,040
And you should be able to see "Hello world!" right here.

1511
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,920
So it's up to you if you want to try this out.

1512
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,400
It gives you kind of a UI to make API calls to your back end if you need to.

1513
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,160
So there's that.

1514
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:55,280
Now with all that, now we can create our API endpoints for our back end.

1515
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,600
So we're going to start with the course controller.

1516
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,760
So in our source directory, we're going to create a new folder.

1517
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,080
We're going to call this course-- actually, sorry, controllers.

1518
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,960
And we're going to create a new file.

1519
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,800
And we're going to call this course controller dot ts.

1520
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:19,200
And by the way, this is the way you would normally structure your back end code.

1521
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,040
You have generally a controllers.

1522
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,840
This is where all your logics exist.

1523
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:27,840
And then you have models where this is a structure of your models.

1524
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,520
It depends on your database, of course.

1525
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,600
And then you're going to have a folder called routes, which we'll create soon.

1526
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,760
And then finally, you'll have all of them routed to the index page.

1527
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,080
This is a typical setup.

1528
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,240
There might be some variations to this.

1529
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,160
But this is generally how you would organize a back end.

1530
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,200
It's pretty structured.

1531
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,080
It's not like the front end where it gets much more chaotic.

1532
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:56,240
Back end tends to be more structured when it comes to the back, the folder structures,

1533
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:56,800
essentially.

1534
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,280
So we're going to go to our controller.

1535
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:05,760
Let's close out everything so we can just focus on course controller.

1536
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,080
And we're going to start with export const list courses.

1537
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,320
And I'm going to do async because this will be an async function.

1538
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:17,760
We're going to do rec with request.

1539
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,600
And that should come from Express for our typings.

1540
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,640
And then res with response.

1541
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,480
And that should also come from Express as well.

1542
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,480
And we're going to give this a promise with a void.

1543
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,120
And we're going to use an arrow function.

1544
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,840
Inside here, I'm going to do const category.

1545
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,840
And we're going to do rec.query like so.

1546
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:51,760
And by the way, when we list our courses, there's going to be a category value that

1547
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,720
comes from the front end, which we can do all or a specific type of category.

1548
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,920
And we are going to use that in a try catch block.

1549
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,240
So we're going to do const courses is equal to category.

1550
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:17,920
And if category is not equal to all, we are going to make request to our Dynamoose database.

1551
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,120
So we're going to do a wait.

1552
01:47:19,120 --> 01:47:25,040
And we are going to bring in the model of course like that.

1553
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:31,680
And we are going to run the scan function, which will grab the back end.

1554
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:38,960
And we can filter it based on category, making sure it's equivalent to the category value.

1555
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,520
And we're going to execute that.

1556
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,640
This is if the category exists.

1557
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:49,520
Otherwise, if it doesn't exist, we're just going to grab the entire course database.

1558
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:57,680
So we're going to do course.scan exec and that executes the entire scan of the course

1559
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,720
table and just grab all that information.

1560
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:05,280
And once we're done, we're going to do res.json.

1561
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:08,480
So we're just going to return a message.

1562
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:13,280
And we're just going to say courses retrieved successfully.

1563
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,360
And we want to pass in data courses.

1564
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:22,720
Now, if you take a look, this is a good way to structure your endpoint.

1565
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:28,720
We have a message that we can send to the front end that you can use to display if you

1566
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:33,920
want to use it for something like notifications or, you know, like alert toast messages.

1567
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,440
We're going to be using this message for that value.

1568
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,560
And then the data is going to be the actual data, of course.

1569
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:47,680
And then from here, we're going to do a catch block in case there is some issue trying to

1570
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:48,720
fetch from the database.

1571
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:52,320
We're going to set res.stat is 500.

1572
01:48:52,320 --> 01:49:03,120
And we're going to say JSON and we're going to give it a message of error retrieving courses.

1573
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,840
And we're going to pass in error.

1574
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:11,440
It's good to have a message that describes where it messed up so you understand that

1575
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:15,840
this is what you created and this is where it basically messed up in your back end.

1576
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,320
OK, so that's pretty straightforward.

1577
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,040
List courses is nothing too difficult.

1578
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,920
We're also going to create a function to grab a single course.

1579
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,880
So we're going to do export const get course.

1580
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,320
And this is just to grab a single course if we need to.

1581
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:33,200
And we're going to do async again.

1582
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:41,120
We're actually just going to copy this entire thing right here to make it easier.

1583
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,160
And you know what?

1584
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,840
Actually, let's just copy this entire thing inside here.

1585
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,040
To make our lives easy, and then we could just replace everything we need.

1586
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:55,840
So for a get course, we're going to actually use a params instead of a query string.

1587
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:02,400
Now, if you're unfamiliar with query versus params, so query strings, let's say you have

1588
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,160
a path, it kind of looks like this.

1589
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:07,760
This is a query string where you have a path question mark.

1590
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,560
And you'll see something like key one is equal to a value.

1591
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,920
Key two is equal to a value.

1592
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,920
And this is generally for more optional parameters.

1593
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,000
So sometimes you don't need it.

1594
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:24,960
Whereas path parameters, which is what we have, rec dot params looks more like this.

1595
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,200
So you'll have it with a slash and it's part of the URL string.

1596
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:35,680
And a lot of times this is more for, you know, this is basically required.

1597
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:40,480
And in get course, you obviously need rec dot params because we need an ID to grab the

1598
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,280
specific type of course information that we want.

1599
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:49,760
So it is more required versus a category, which is much more optional in this regard.

1600
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:57,360
So speaking of rec dot params, we need course ID, which we grab from the rec dot params.

1601
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:04,720
Inside our try block, we're going to put a course and we're going to await course dot

1602
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:06,880
get course ID.

1603
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:12,240
So this just grabs the course specifically with the course ID pretty straightforward.

1604
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:16,800
And we obviously want to check if the course does not exist.

1605
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:22,800
We want to do res dot status 404, which generally means something was not found.

1606
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:30,080
So we're going to say course not found that gets sent to the front end and we are going

1607
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,760
to return and exit out.

1608
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:38,640
Otherwise, we're going to say course with the singular retrieve successfully and we

1609
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,560
want to pass in singular course.

1610
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,440
And we want to change this error retrieving course to be singular as well.

1611
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,600
Pretty straightforward.

1612
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,880
These two are pretty simple.

1613
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,440
It's going to get complicated eventually, but for now we're keeping it simple.

1614
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:59,200
So now we have these controllers, which includes the logic, but we also need to create the

1615
01:51:59,200 --> 01:51:59,600
routes.

1616
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,800
So we're going to create a folder.

1617
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:05,360
We're going to call this routes and we're going to pass in a new file called this course

1618
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,560
routes dot TS.

1619
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:13,600
And for something like this, we need to import express, especially because we're using

1620
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,680
multiple files.

1621
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:22,240
When you use multiple files, you're going to use router is equal to express dot router.

1622
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:28,160
So this allows us to divert the different routes that we have for our back end.

1623
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:36,080
And all we have to do is router dot get and we're just going to put a slash comma list

1624
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:36,720
courses.

1625
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:39,440
So that is going to be grabbed from a course controller.

1626
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:45,360
So now this is not this is right now it's saying it's the home route, but we're going

1627
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:48,560
to have an entry point for this later on.

1628
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:56,960
And then we're also going to do router dot get do slash colon course ID like so.

1629
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:59,600
And we want to import get course as well.

1630
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:04,080
Make sure you use IntelliSense for all of this to make it easier.

1631
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,840
And finally, we're just going to do export default router.

1632
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:12,640
Once we have this, we can then go to the index file.

1633
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:18,000
And this is where we can have an entry point for this category of routes.

1634
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:24,640
So when we create these course routes, this is specifically routes for course controllers.

1635
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:29,760
So this is a very specific category of routes that we have.

1636
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:38,240
And I can just say app dot use slash courses and we can import course routes, which will

1637
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,720
have to manually do it up here.

1638
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:51,040
So I'm going to import course routes from dot slash routes slash course routes from

1639
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,000
our endpoint.

1640
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:59,360
So basically, to hit our endpoint, we are going to hit the slash courses, which can

1641
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:02,160
involve hitting this endpoint.

1642
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:06,640
So if I just write, let's actually just call this.

1643
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:12,960
I just want to show you we're going to use curl HTTP colon slash slash local host colon

1644
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,600
8001 slash courses.

1645
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:20,320
So we're going to say courses retrieved successfully.

1646
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,000
But right now, the data is empty because we have not seeded our data.

1647
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,920
So that is exactly how you would hit your courses.

1648
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:32,480
Now, if you wanted to hit the get course, you would pass in.

1649
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:39,040
You would pass in slash, you know, some whatever ID of the course right here.

1650
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:42,640
But we need to seed our data first.

1651
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,000
So let's do that.

1652
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:49,200
Now, seeding data always makes me a bit nervous because every single time I've encountered

1653
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:50,960
a lot of issues trying to see data.

1654
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,360
But let's give this a shot.

1655
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,720
So right now we have this seed function.

1656
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,320
I created the seed file.

1657
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,320
You don't have to worry about what's happening here.

1658
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,720
But so let's try running it.

1659
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,920
NPM run seed.

1660
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,000
See what happens.

1661
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,640
So we have table deleted course.

1662
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:13,440
Created initialized transaction user course progress.

1663
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,680
Created course as well.

1664
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:19,920
And we have successfully seeded all our data.

1665
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,120
So hopefully that worked out.

1666
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:29,200
And for us to check, we can actually go and finally open up our NoSQL workbench.

1667
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,280
We're going to add a connection.

1668
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:34,000
Click DynamoDB local.

1669
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Make sure it's set to port 8000.

1670
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,840
We're going to hit connect.

1671
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,080
We're then going to hit open.

1672
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,960
And if it's successful, we should be able to see course transaction.

1673
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,440
And user course progress.

1674
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,240
So perfect.

1675
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:50,160
Everything is working as possible.

1676
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:56,320
Just FYI, it is possible you might have some issues with seeding database.

1677
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:03,600
Hopefully this code works out because seeding has never been easy for me to get correct.

1678
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:08,640
Because the data is always kind of messed up or there's some random issue that occurs.

1679
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:14,080
So do your best to try and resolve what you can for seeding the database.

1680
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:16,000
Hopefully it just works off right off the bat.

1681
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,480
Once we have this, now we have seed data.

1682
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:24,400
And actually, yeah, it was already running.

1683
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,000
So there's a little no point.

1684
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,560
So I'm going to open up another terminal.

1685
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,080
You just only have to have one server.

1686
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:34,000
I accidentally had two servers running.

1687
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:44,160
So I'm just going to do curl HTTP colon slash slash local host colon 8001 slash courses.

1688
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:50,560
And that should basically give us our course list.

1689
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,800
So now this is very unreadable.

1690
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,320
And that's why, you know, curl is not very useful in this regard.

1691
01:56:56,320 --> 01:57:02,160
But if you were to go to postman, I can do slash courses.

1692
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,160
We should be able to send.

1693
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:10,480
And now we can see in a very nice formatted way of all the course information that we have over here.

1694
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:16,800
And this basically should reflect what we have in our seed data.

1695
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,600
So right here is exactly what we should be seeing.

1696
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:24,640
And if we actually wanted to see the other endpoints, so we have slash courses.

1697
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,440
We also want to do course ID.

1698
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:31,680
So if I grab this first one, we should be able to get this specific course.

1699
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:36,160
And only that one.

1700
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:38,160
So it's a little bit jumbled.

1701
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:42,000
We can just instead use our postman.

1702
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,600
To send.

1703
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,360
Yeah.

1704
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:50,080
And as you can see, this is only one course.

1705
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,760
When we grab the courses, we're just getting that single course.

1706
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,000
So everything is working as expected.

1707
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,960
And now, since we have finally set up our back end, we have our courses endpoint.

1708
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,000
We can now go back to our front end.

1709
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
So we're going to close all of these.

1710
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,880
Close up server.

1711
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:11,520
Now we're going to go to our source directory.

1712
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,320
So now we need a way to call our back end.

1713
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:18,960
And that is where Redux Toolkit query comes into play.

1714
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,640
And that exists in our API directory.

1715
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,480
So API file, I mean.

1716
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:30,240
So in our API.ts, we can go to our endpoints.

1717
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:33,600
So this is exactly where you would place API calls.

1718
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:38,800
So now, as we have seen, we have .env.local.

1719
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,440
This is the endpoint that we reach.

1720
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:46,320
But these endpoints will tack on whatever URL that we want.

1721
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,840
And it's, in a way, abstracted away for you.

1722
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,440
And it makes the code pretty nice to use.

1723
01:58:53,440 --> 01:59:00,320
So in the endpoints, I'm going to call this list or get courses.

1724
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:03,680
And we're going to do build.query.

1725
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:10,880
And inside the build.query, this is what we are going to receive from the back end.

1726
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:15,440
So in this type, this is the type that we get from the back end.

1727
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:21,680
And what we need to send is going to be on the second part of this query.

1728
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:28,320
And this is going to be category with a question mark colon string.

1729
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,400
And we're going to close this.

1730
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:35,040
And we're going to do curly braces with query like so.

1731
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:41,360
And inside here, we're going to pass in the category,

1732
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:48,240
which is what we're going to pass in when we call this particular hook inside the component.

1733
01:59:48,240 --> 01:59:49,040
We'll come to it.

1734
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,120
But for now, let's build this out.

1735
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,200
We are going to set the URL to be courses.

1736
01:59:55,200 --> 02:00:02,000
So basically, this part right here is going to be tacked onto the URL local host right here.

1737
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,680
So it will tack on courses like this when we make this particular endpoint API call.

1738
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:12,080
And then from here, we want to send the params to be category.

1739
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:20,080
So this is going to come from where we call this basic hook that gets created from Redux toolkit.

1740
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:23,920
And we pass that into the params for our query string.

1741
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:29,120
And then finally, we have provides tags.

1742
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:34,480
And we want to set this to be courses within a string.

1743
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,800
So I forgot a comma here.

1744
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,920
So make sure you have that in the tag types.

1745
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:42,560
We are going to add courses as well right here.

1746
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,960
So essentially, what these tag types are,

1747
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:51,520
they basically represent the data that we receive from the back end.

1748
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:56,080
So when we do get courses, we're getting a list of courses.

1749
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,800
And we are saving it to a tag of courses.

1750
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:04,560
This will be important when we do invalidation of courses.

1751
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,640
But we'll talk about that a little later.

1752
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:12,720
And then over here in our export const, we're going to write use get courses query.

1753
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:17,120
So the standardization of this tag name is pretty simple.

1754
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,480
You have get courses.

1755
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:24,080
So all you have to do is add a use with a prefix and query for the suffix.

1756
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:27,440
Now while we're here, we'll do the same thing for the get course.

1757
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,360
So this is for the single one.

1758
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,000
This time, we're just going to copy the build query like we did.

1759
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,600
But this is not going to be an array.

1760
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:40,800
And also, we're just going to pass in a string when we make the API call.

1761
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,040
So query is going to be ID.

1762
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:50,720
And the path is going to be courses slash ID like this.

1763
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:53,520
So this is how we make an API call to the back end.

1764
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:58,800
Remember when we did courses slash the ID value, this is how we grab it.

1765
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,240
And we're going to do provides tags like so.

1766
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:05,360
And actually, let's not use that.

1767
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,120
In telesense, we're going to do result error ID like so.

1768
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:20,960
And what we're going to do is we're going to do basically an array.

1769
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:24,800
And we are going to do type courses.

1770
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,320
And we are going to do ID.

1771
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:31,200
Now this may be a little confusing.

1772
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:35,760
But basically, what happens is that when we grab the course,

1773
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,080
we are going to find the type of courses for the tags.

1774
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:45,200
But we're going to find one that has the exact ID of the get course.

1775
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:51,760
And the reason why we need to specify this is so that when we grab this course,

1776
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:59,440
if we grab it individually, it's going to update the course values automatically on the front end.

1777
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:04,240
So basically, when we grab the list of courses, and then we call get course,

1778
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:08,400
it's going to update that specific course in this list.

1779
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:13,520
So it's a way of doing invalidation that makes life a lot easier.

1780
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:16,960
And this is similar to React query.

1781
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,360
So it's not anything that different from React query, if you're just confused.

1782
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,840
But it is pretty much identical.

1783
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:29,040
And we're just going to do use get course query as well.

1784
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:30,880
And that's that.

1785
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,720
That's how you can make an API call.

1786
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:38,880
So we want to do from here to make the API call, I'm going to go to components or actually

1787
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,280
app page, we're going to go to the landing page.

1788
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:55,120
And we're going to scroll up, we're going to do const data, courses is loading, is error.

1789
02:03:56,320 --> 02:04:02,560
And we're going to grab use get course is query that we created the plural one,

1790
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,160
I'm going to pass an empty array.

1791
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:09,520
And by doing so, we can grab the courses value.

1792
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,960
So for now, let's console log this and see what we have on the front end.

1793
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:19,360
Now you're seeing this linting error, mostly because it's just not being used.

1794
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,360
But let's check this out.

1795
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,840
So I put the browser over here.

1796
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,680
Right now, we're not running the front end,

1797
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,880
we're running the back end, but we're not running the front end.

1798
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,440
So I'm going to go back to our parent directory,

1799
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:35,360
go into our client, and I'm going to run npm run dev.

1800
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:42,480
All right, so now when you have the server running, we're going to open up our dev tools,

1801
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:49,520
you can do it via alt command I, if you're using browser or a brave browser or Chrome.

1802
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:54,480
So you have it up here, you can see that we have our courses object,

1803
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:56,880
courses retrieved successfully.

1804
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,320
And in the data object, we have our list of images,

1805
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:04,640
we have all of this information, including enrollments, sections,

1806
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:06,080
and all of these chapters.

1807
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:08,720
So we have our entire course object successfully.

1808
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:12,400
Now, I want to warn you about something weird,

1809
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:16,640
is that you also see courses undefined inside the terminal.

1810
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:23,200
So we're basically grabbing the courses information on the next JS server side.

1811
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,320
So why is that?

1812
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:31,120
So if you understand how next JS works, is that this component gets run two times,

1813
02:05:31,120 --> 02:05:33,280
it gets run on the server.

1814
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:37,120
And it also gets run on the client side.

1815
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:40,960
So before it goes to the client, like to the user,

1816
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:43,760
it runs this entire component as well.

1817
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:49,520
But it cannot fetch courses on the server side.

1818
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:56,000
So instead, we're fetching the data when this application is hit on the front end,

1819
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,760
and then we grab the courses information after that.

1820
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,120
That's how we grab it.

1821
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:05,280
Now, we're not going to go into next JS details where you can do server side components,

1822
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:09,200
or server components, and you're fetching the data on the server side.

1823
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:12,640
We're going to stick with Redux toolkit query,

1824
02:06:12,640 --> 02:06:15,040
and we're going to do everything client side.

1825
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:21,680
I will have a video on explaining next JS why sometimes it's okay to do something like this,

1826
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:25,040
and it's not that detrimental to your performance or any of that.

1827
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:26,640
You don't need to.

1828
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:32,560
It really isn't completely necessary unless you need big performance gains.

1829
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:38,080
Otherwise, it adds a lot of development overhead and complicates things in many different areas.

1830
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,240
There's a reason why a lot of people complain about it.

1831
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:44,720
But either way, we're sticking with this pattern for now.

1832
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,160
So now, I want to bring your attention to the console.

1833
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:52,080
So now, if you see the courses, we have this data.

1834
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:56,720
So now, if you do course, the reason why it's set up to be courses.data,

1835
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:58,640
which is kind of inconvenient to use.

1836
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,880
And this is kind of the part where I really like Redux toolkit query.

1837
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:08,000
It makes it so much easier to do this on a complete scale.

1838
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:16,960
So if I were to go to this base query, we can actually format this across all our endpoints

1839
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:22,240
because all our endpoints is going to have that structure where we have the data object.

1840
02:07:22,240 --> 02:07:25,360
So let's go back to our controller.

1841
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:29,760
When we set this, we have a message and a data.

1842
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:33,360
But we also want to, when we grab the data,

1843
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,760
we always want to just grab the course information.

1844
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,120
For example, like this, we don't want to write courses.data.

1845
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,200
We just want to use the courses information directly.

1846
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:48,080
And the way you can do that is if you were to go over here into this base query,

1847
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:54,240
we can actually just define our own custom base query up here.

1848
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:57,600
And we're just going to use orgs.

1849
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:03,440
So when you set this up, you're just going to grab different types.

1850
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,160
So we can make this basically work.

1851
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:10,720
Right now, we're just dealing with types for this.

1852
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:16,080
Do extra options with an empty object.

1853
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,400
And we're going to do an arrow function.

1854
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:23,840
From here, I'm going to set the base query to be the same thing.

1855
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,520
So we're just going to copy this over.

1856
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:30,800
We're going to set this up so we have the base query and the base URL just like this.

1857
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,480
Now, right now, we can do a try and then we can do a result,

1858
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:38,400
which will grab information from the back end.

1859
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:42,640
So anytime we make an endpoint like a get courses call,

1860
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,120
it's going to run through this custom base query.

1861
02:08:45,120 --> 02:08:49,280
And it's going to apply it to every single endpoint.

1862
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:54,720
So both get courses and get course, this will basically be a custom version.

1863
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:58,400
So we can modify it to whatever we want.

1864
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:05,120
So right here, we're going to do args API, extra options like so.

1865
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:11,360
And typically, if you just want the same results, we can just do return results.

1866
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,800
So this will basically make it so nothing has changed.

1867
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:19,760
Let's just make sure we do catch error is going to be unknown.

1868
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:23,680
We just want to make sure the error message works out.

1869
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:27,440
So we're going to do error instance of error.

1870
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:32,160
These are just this is just error handling in the proper practice.

1871
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:36,880
So we're just going to give this unknown error if none of this works out,

1872
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,560
because we can't always predict what the error message is going to be.

1873
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:48,240
So we're going to give it a status of fetch underscore error.

1874
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:52,320
And error is going to be error message.

1875
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:55,760
Now, you don't have to worry about what this is happening.

1876
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,520
It's just error handling.

1877
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:00,000
It's up to you on how to handle it.

1878
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,040
So right now, this will give us the exact same result that we have already been doing.

1879
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:08,560
But let's say if we wanted to do what we mentioned before,

1880
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:12,000
where the data is going to be the actual result,

1881
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,720
we can just set this to result data and we can set this to be result data data.

1882
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:22,880
So basically, it unwraps our data directly.

1883
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,520
And by the way, should actually copy this.

1884
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:28,800
Some of the typing is incorrect.

1885
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,440
So create API and fetch base query should be correct.

1886
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:36,960
But not for this right here.

1887
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:39,600
We should remove slash react.

1888
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:43,440
We can move create API, fetch base query from that

1889
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,520
and remove fetch args and base query API like this.

1890
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,600
And we can just change this to be any because it's causing issues.

1891
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:56,960
And finally, what we need to do to actually use that custom base query,

1892
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,960
we're going to write custom base query like this, save it.

1893
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:06,400
And if we go back to our courses object, refresh.

1894
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:10,640
Now, we should actually see this is our data.

1895
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:12,320
We no longer have the message.

1896
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:13,760
We don't need the message.

1897
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:18,240
But we just have the array of objects right here.

1898
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:19,840
And that's exactly what we want.

1899
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:24,000
And that's why I really like Redux toolkit query.

1900
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,320
Now, you can do the same thing in Zestand,

1901
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,640
but it's just a little more boilerplate.

1902
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:32,800
A lot of this is kind of structured in to Redux toolkit query.

1903
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,240
Makes it very easy to do.

1904
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:35,520
All right.

1905
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,760
So now we can go back to our landing page

1906
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,520
and we can continue on with our courses information.

1907
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,080
So we can go down to our landing courses section.

1908
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:48,720
And inside the courses display,

1909
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:51,920
now we can actually put the courses as well.

1910
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:59,360
And if courses exist, we are going to grab the first four courses just for easy sake.

1911
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:05,360
Typically, you would hand code, figure out which courses that you want to feature.

1912
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:07,760
So that's just dependent on what you want to do.

1913
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:12,320
But in this case, we're just going to show the first four courses.

1914
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:18,640
We're going to do a course index with an arrow function, pass in motion.div.

1915
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:26,720
So back to our animation, I'm going to go back up, copy these values again.

1916
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:33,280
So we don't have to write it and we're going to pass in a key.

1917
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:40,160
The key is going to be course.courseId, like so.

1918
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:43,040
And we're going to change a few things.

1919
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,840
So opacity is going to be zero,

1920
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,360
but we want this to be moved up 50.

1921
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:53,200
So 50 from the bottom and it goes up 50 pixels.

1922
02:12:53,200 --> 02:12:58,640
So while in view, it's going to go to its supposed final destination.

1923
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:03,360
Transition is going to be a duration of 0.5.

1924
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:12,000
But because we have a list, we can say delay with index multiplied by 0.2.

1925
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,160
So that means every single course gets delayed 0.2 seconds.

1926
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:18,640
And for this, we don't need once.

1927
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:22,080
We're just going to have it repeat anytime we want.

1928
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:27,040
So the viewport amount is going to be 0.4, which is a nice good number.

1929
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,280
We're going to get rid of class name for this one.

1930
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,880
And we're just going to put random text over here.

1931
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:39,040
And you can see that we have a little bit of a cool animation going on.

1932
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:42,160
But we want to display the course information.

1933
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:44,400
So we're going to create a course card.

1934
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:49,840
And we're going to call this search because we're going to have multiple course cards as well.

1935
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:54,720
So in here, we are going to have a course.

1936
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:59,360
And we're going to pass in the course information that we grabbed

1937
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:03,280
and from the course data that we retrieved.

1938
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:06,080
So let's create that.

1939
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:09,280
So we're going to go back, go to our components directory.

1940
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:10,800
I'm going to create a new file.

1941
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:15,920
And the reason why we're creating it over here is because we're going to use this component

1942
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:17,360
in two different spots.

1943
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:22,160
So anytime we reuse any kind of component, we're putting it in the components directory.

1944
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:26,800
So I'm going to start with RAFCE with course card search.

1945
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:31,280
And inside here, it's going to take a couple parameters.

1946
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:39,920
We're going to check if course width is selected and on click.

1947
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:43,040
So it's going to take three props.

1948
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:47,600
And we are going to pass in search course card props, which is already created.

1949
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:56,160
Now, by the way, I haven't explained this, but these types are created from the index.d.ts

1950
02:14:56,160 --> 02:15:01,680
that we transferred earlier because I did not want to focus on writing all of these

1951
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:06,640
type typings, which is kind of annoying to do on a tutorial.

1952
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:10,080
And it's not very instructive for me to just spend time on doing so.

1953
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,560
So we have that.

1954
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:20,240
Inside our return, we are going to pass in a number of things.

1955
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:23,200
So on click is going to be right here.

1956
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:29,840
So we're going to have an on click handler that we passed in from the component props.

1957
02:15:30,640 --> 02:15:32,240
We're also going to have a class name.

1958
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:36,640
We're going to pass in course card search.

1959
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:40,480
And we're going to group this with the class.

1960
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:43,600
And we're going to make sure if it is selected.

1961
02:15:43,600 --> 02:15:49,440
And this is for situations where we are on the search page.

1962
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:51,120
So right now we're on the landing page.

1963
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:54,400
So is selected is not a relevant prop.

1964
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:58,400
But when we're on the selected page, we'll come to it where we will use this.

1965
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,880
But we're going to create this right now.

1966
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:07,760
So we're going to say course card, course card search to be selected like so.

1967
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:13,520
And we are going to say course card search.

1968
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:16,080
And this is if it's unselected.

1969
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:19,920
So we'll have two different stylings for selection versus unselected.

1970
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:27,040
Inside here, we're going to have a div with class name of course card search.

1971
02:16:28,080 --> 02:16:30,480
And an image container.

1972
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:38,320
And we're going to have an image tag or image element from next image.

1973
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:42,080
And we're going to pass in source with course dot image.

1974
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:48,160
And we're just going to put placeholder dot png.

1975
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:51,520
Now it doesn't exist, but you can add it if you want.

1976
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:54,000
So it's like a backup image.

1977
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,720
And we're going to pass in course dot title for the alt.

1978
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,280
Give it a fill property.

1979
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,960
And if you remember, we're going to use sizes for optimization purposes.

1980
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:14,240
We're going to put max width of 768 pixel for 100 viewport width.

1981
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:23,280
Max width of 1200 pixel for 50 viewport width, 33 viewport width.

1982
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:30,960
And then class name is going to be course card search.

1983
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:34,960
Let's actually copy this so we don't have to write it every single time.

1984
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:38,640
And we're going to do double underscore image.

1985
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:42,160
And we're going to make a self-closing tag for the image like that.

1986
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:48,240
So I know we still have an error happening, but we're going to continue.

1987
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,240
We're going to create and finish this course card.

1988
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,720
Finish this out.

1989
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:54,240
So we're going to start with the class name.

1990
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,960
Paste that course card search.

1991
02:17:56,960 --> 02:18:00,160
Double underscore with content.

1992
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:06,400
And inside here, we're going to give it a div with h2 class name.

1993
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:11,280
Pass in the search double underscore title.

1994
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:16,400
Pass in course dot title for the h2.

1995
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:20,000
And then have a p tag.

1996
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,680
We're going to do class name, course card search, double underscore description.

1997
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:30,240
And then we're going to pass in course dot description like this.

1998
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:33,680
And then continue forward.

1999
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:38,080
We're going to do div class name with margin top of 2.

2000
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:41,280
Close this out with the p tag.

2001
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:48,240
Class name is equal to course card search again with teacher.

2002
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:56,160
And we're going to do by course dot teacher name like so.

2003
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,440
We don't need that.

2004
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:04,320
And on the next line, we're just going to do div again.

2005
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:08,800
Class name is equal to course card search footer.

2006
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:18,480
And we're going to pass in a span with class name, course card search, price.

2007
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:19,600
Like so.

2008
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:26,160
And it should be format price, which is going to be a util that we have.

2009
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:30,960
It's going to format the course into the proper values.

2010
02:19:30,960 --> 02:19:32,640
So it's just a very convenient function.

2011
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:34,720
I don't want to spend time doing that.

2012
02:19:34,720 --> 02:19:39,760
And then we're also going to have another span with class name, course card search,

2013
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,600
enrollment.

2014
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:48,800
And over here, I'm going to say course enrollment, question mark dot length.

2015
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:51,440
Enrolled.

2016
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:55,040
So that will set up our entire course card.

2017
02:19:55,040 --> 02:20:02,160
So right now, it is still showing an error because if we go back here, we are missing some props.

2018
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:07,680
And the only prop we're basically missing is going to be the on click handler.

2019
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:15,760
So when you click on the course over here, if you see this pages, when you click it,

2020
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:17,440
it should take you to the search page.

2021
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:25,680
And it should take you to specifically the course ID with the query string on that page.

2022
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:30,640
So it will be selected on this page, but we haven't created that page yet.

2023
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:34,800
But let's create the route handling just for that.

2024
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:36,320
So let's open this up.

2025
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:42,080
And I'm going to go up here right under landing.

2026
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:48,320
We're going to give a function called handle course click.

2027
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,280
Like so.

2028
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:58,880
And inside here, we're going to pass in course ID with the string type with an arrow function.

2029
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:03,360
And we are going to do router dot push, which we have not defined yet.

2030
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:14,160
It's going to be slash search question ID is equal to dollar sign course ID.

2031
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:19,840
Now, the router should come from next JS.

2032
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:24,240
So we're going to do router is equal to use router from next router.

2033
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:26,480
We're going to execute that.

2034
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:28,320
And that should give us router dot push.

2035
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:35,040
And we should go down and we can finally go over here to course guard search.

2036
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:40,480
We're going to do on click handle course click, and we can just pass that in.

2037
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:47,360
And actually, this needs to be an arrow function because we need to be able to pass in the course.

2038
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:52,080
So I'm going to do course dot course ID like so.

2039
02:21:53,280 --> 02:22:00,080
And we are getting this error, and that's because we are using the wrong one.

2040
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:05,440
So this is next router, but next navigation should be the correct one.

2041
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:07,600
And there we go.

2042
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:09,200
We have another different error.

2043
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:15,280
So we need to import course card search from at components course card search.

2044
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:19,040
And even with all that, we're going to get this particular error.

2045
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,800
And that's because let's go over here.

2046
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:27,120
That's because we need to configure this hosting URL because these are remote images.

2047
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:32,480
So let's open up our directory in our client directory.

2048
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:34,080
We're going to create a new file.

2049
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:37,920
We're going to call this next dot config dot JS.

2050
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:44,720
And I'm going to write this weird comment thing right here.

2051
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:46,880
Let's close this.

2052
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:56,880
And then we're going to do at type import parens next dot next config like this.

2053
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:03,920
And over here, I'm going to say const next config is equal to an object.

2054
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:09,760
We're going to say images with remote patterns with an array.

2055
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:21,440
And we're going to say protocol is going to be HTTPS comma host name with images dot pexels dot

2056
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:23,840
com because this is where we're getting the image.

2057
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:25,840
It's just a free image that we're just using.

2058
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:33,680
And we're going to give it a port with empty string path name with slash star star.

2059
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:38,080
So it allows all the path from the host name.

2060
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:43,040
And we're going to do module dot exports is equal to next config.

2061
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:45,360
And then we're going to save that.

2062
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:50,720
If we open up our server, let's try refreshing it.

2063
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:53,120
Let's refresh it one more time.

2064
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:57,280
And now we can see we have our course list.

2065
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,600
Everything is all perfect.

2066
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:00,800
We have the animations.

2067
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:05,920
If we scroll up here, we can see that if we refresh it, we're going to see these courses.

2068
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:12,400
Now, we don't see the loading skeleton, but let's actually implement the loading skeleton this time.

2069
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:17,760
So if you go down here, I'm going to do if is loading.

2070
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:24,800
And by the way, we have react to query with is loading.

2071
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:29,760
So that determines when the courses are being received from the back end.

2072
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,480
We're going to pass in the loading skeleton.

2073
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:35,360
And we can see save it.

2074
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:41,760
And see that we have our skeleton coming in.

2075
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:47,440
So if you refresh it, you can see it's not exactly what we saw earlier.

2076
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:51,840
So if I go over here, there's actually a class name that we need to add.

2077
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,160
I'm going to go over here, right.

2078
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:56,960
BG gray 700.

2079
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:59,920
And this is part of the tailwind skeleton.

2080
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:02,720
So if you look at here, this is in the UI.

2081
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:05,600
We just need to add that specific thing.

2082
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:12,560
And now if I refresh it, now you should be able to see everything in terms of the skeleton working out.

2083
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:16,160
Refresh it.

2084
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:17,120
It looks pretty nice.

2085
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:21,040
So now there's a couple of things I want to actually add.

2086
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:28,320
So if I go to the app layout page, like the root, there's actually one thing I wanted to do

2087
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:34,240
is if I go into div right here, just to make everything consistent,

2088
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:36,640
we want to add a class of root layout.

2089
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:41,840
So this is just going to be applied on our entire application.

2090
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:42,240
Yeah.

2091
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:47,360
By the way, this layout file, it applies to the entire application.

2092
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:50,080
So if you have any styling there, it's going to apply it.

2093
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:53,840
Now, right now, it's not going to really change anything because most of it's there.

2094
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:55,120
All right.

2095
02:25:55,120 --> 02:26:02,240
And then one more thing, I want to add a layout page for non-dashboard.

2096
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:06,720
So this will apply to every single page, not just the search page,

2097
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:12,160
because right now we have this set up in our home page.

2098
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,600
So that's only for home page.

2099
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:20,080
But if we wanted to create a search page, so I'm eventually going to have a folder called search.

2100
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:25,680
I want a layout that mimics exactly that because we need the non-dashboard

2101
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:29,200
navbar over here and we want to apply that for every single page.

2102
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:36,320
So going back to over here, let's actually just copy this entire thing,

2103
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:43,680
paste it over here in this non-dashboard, and we're going to give it a layout.

2104
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:46,720
And we're going to pass in children like so.

2105
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:58,880
Give it children with react.react node like this.

2106
02:26:58,880 --> 02:27:03,680
And inside of here, it's going to be children like this.

2107
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:07,520
So we don't need to pass in landing.

2108
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:15,440
And so if we go to /landing page, we should see the exact same layout.

2109
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:21,600
And there's one thing that I did mess up once again in non-dashboard navbar.

2110
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:26,800
If you see this area right here under book open, there's four closing divs.

2111
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:32,720
One of these divs should actually be near the end like this.

2112
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:39,200
When you save it, this navbar should be the same width as the rest of the page.

2113
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,080
So it was just like a small mishap.

2114
02:27:42,080 --> 02:27:44,480
I always have some issues with that.

2115
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:46,880
All right.

2116
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:49,760
So from here, we're going to handle the search page.

2117
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:53,520
So in our finished application, if you hit search for courses,

2118
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,440
you're going to see this particular page.

2119
02:27:55,440 --> 02:28:03,120
What's going to happen is on larger screens, you're going to see multiple courses.

2120
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:06,160
And then responsive, it's going to be one.

2121
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:10,640
But over here is going to be a selected course.

2122
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:15,040
When you are on the search page, it's going to show the first selected course.

2123
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:20,000
But if you click on the second one, you're going to see the ID being passed

2124
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,160
once you click on one of these search.

2125
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:26,480
And you can also go back over here, go to featured courses.

2126
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:30,960
You click and you can see that the search ID has been selected.

2127
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:33,360
And we can go to this particular page.

2128
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:39,280
We're also going to create this nice little accordion that shows each of these sections.

2129
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:42,960
And just remember, all of this information is coming from the backend.

2130
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:48,880
So it's pretty nice that we are connected to a backend that is not managed.

2131
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:52,240
This is we are managing the backend ourselves.

2132
02:28:52,240 --> 02:28:53,360
So let's get started.

2133
02:28:53,360 --> 02:29:01,520
So to start off, we're going to go to the search page and we are going to create a page over here.

2134
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:06,320
We're going to do RFCE and put search like this.

2135
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:10,960
And over here, we're going to grab the search params.

2136
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:13,920
Let me open this up like this.

2137
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:21,680
We're going to grab the search params so we can grab it from the URL.

2138
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:29,840
And then we're going to identify the ID via searchparams.get.

2139
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,600
So this is all part of next.

2140
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:35,120
And you can grab the ID value from the URL.

2141
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:41,600
We always want to grab the URL and grab information from the URL.

2142
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:47,760
So sometimes you can use the URL in Next.js as your own as a state.

2143
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:51,280
Instead of using Redux or instead of using local state,

2144
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:56,160
you want to use the URL state because it's a lot more reliable to do so.

2145
02:29:56,160 --> 02:30:00,480
From here, we're going to grab courses.

2146
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:03,360
Is loading, is error.

2147
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:10,320
And we're going to use the same function that we called earlier using use get queries.

2148
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:15,680
We're going to pass in an empty object to grab the courses information.

2149
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:19,120
And then finally, we're going to create a state.

2150
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,040
And we're going to call this selected course because this is going to save the selected

2151
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:24,000
course information.

2152
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:31,920
And we're going to set use state like so with course null.

2153
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:36,080
And we're going to pass in the null value over here.

2154
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,880
Now use state is not defined.

2155
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,320
So we're going to pass that in.

2156
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:44,960
And finally, we're going to grab the router because we want to

2157
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:51,360
change pages if we click on one of the search courses.

2158
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:54,800
So we're going to grab it from next navigation as well.

2159
02:30:54,800 --> 02:31:01,040
Now you see all these underscore that's from our linting that they're not being used.

2160
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:02,000
But it's OK.

2161
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:09,920
So here to do with the situation where we have a course ID, if the course ID exists,

2162
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:13,520
we're going to set that one as the selected course.

2163
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:18,800
But if it doesn't have any search, we are going to set the first course as a selected

2164
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:19,680
option.

2165
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:22,240
And the way we do this is we're going to use use effect.

2166
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:27,520
Now, personally, I always try to minimize the amount of use effect.

2167
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:31,120
And this is one of the situations where, you know, I could use the params.

2168
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:37,120
But sometimes it is easier, especially in a situation like this, to use use effect because

2169
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:42,080
use effect is problematic because you run into a lot of asynchronous issues.

2170
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:47,120
If you have too many use effects, they can coin conflict and cause a lot of problems.

2171
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:49,200
So you have to be very careful.

2172
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:52,080
And you always want to try to minimize.

2173
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:56,800
You can't avoid it completely, obviously, but you always want to minimize the number

2174
02:31:56,800 --> 02:32:00,800
of use effect hooks that you have in your react components.

2175
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:09,440
So basically, if the courses exist, but also if the ID exists, we're going to say we grab

2176
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:15,920
the courses and we're going to find the course ID that we have.

2177
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:24,800
So we are going to grab the course ID and see if it is equal to the ID we have in the

2178
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:25,840
search params.

2179
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:30,480
So we're going to find that specific course, get that information, and we're going to

2180
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:34,560
set the selected course as the value.

2181
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:40,880
Otherwise, we are going to set the courses to be zero if it doesn't exist.

2182
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:45,440
If for whatever reason, it has problems finding it.

2183
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:52,080
Otherwise, if the ID does not exist, like we said, we are going to set selected course

2184
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:57,920
to be the first value or the first course in the courses array.

2185
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:02,720
And finally, we want to add some dependencies.

2186
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:04,160
We're going to add courses.

2187
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:08,480
So it'll rerun anytime these values change.

2188
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:14,640
So anyways, from here, we want to make sure that the courses are loaded.

2189
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:18,640
So we're going to have an is loading state and we're going to return and we're going

2190
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:20,800
to create a component called loading.

2191
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:25,120
Now you could put text or you can customize the loading component, but we're going to

2192
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,760
have a default loading component for every situation that will make it look nice.

2193
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:35,200
And even though it's not going to be very specific for what's loading, this is going

2194
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:40,160
to show us a loading spinner and it's super easy to create.

2195
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:45,120
So in the components folder, I'm going to create loading that TSX.

2196
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:50,720
Inside here, I'm going to do RAFCE as usual.

2197
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:56,720
I'm going to give this a class name with loading like this.

2198
02:33:56,720 --> 02:34:05,120
And in here, I'm going to bring in loader two from Lucide React.

2199
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:10,880
So it's basically an icon, but we're going to give it a class name of loading double

2200
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:11,920
underscore spinner.

2201
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:17,680
So this is just going to spin and animate the loader icon.

2202
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:26,080
And this will make a very nice little effect and will give us a very nice loading component

2203
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:28,720
that's super easy and we can put this anywhere.

2204
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:32,960
And we also want the text of loading dot dot dot.

2205
02:34:32,960 --> 02:34:35,600
So we have this class name loading text.

2206
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:41,200
So if we have this, we can now pass in this loading component.

2207
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:44,080
Make sure we import that.

2208
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,840
Now, if we go to the search page.

2209
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:56,560
We have this error use rather that just means we need to set this to be used client.

2210
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:02,320
And I'm just going to show you how that is the loading spinner looks like.

2211
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:08,400
So if you take a look, we have a very convincing loading screen or a loading icon.

2212
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:13,200
And this is very nice because it's so simple and it works in any kind of situation.

2213
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,400
So we're just going to remove that.

2214
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:21,520
And in here, we also want to get check for errors.

2215
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:26,880
So we're going to say is error and we are going to say if courses does not exist, we're

2216
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:32,000
going to return div failed to fetch courses like so.

2217
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,200
Now, inside here, I'm going to select both of these with alt.

2218
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:38,640
I'm going to write motion dot.

2219
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:43,840
Div and we are going to import framer motion.

2220
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,120
So let me just move this out so we have more space.

2221
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:54,000
We're going to import motion from framer motion, and that should quiet this guy out.

2222
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:00,080
And we're going to say initial is going to be opacity of zero.

2223
02:36:01,120 --> 02:36:12,720
Animate with opacity of one transition with duration of zero point five and a class name

2224
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,400
of search.

2225
02:36:14,400 --> 02:36:20,800
And then from here, I'm going to give this an H1 tag, say class name is equal to search

2226
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:29,760
double underscore title with list of available courses.

2227
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:38,400
Below this, I'm going to have an H2 tag with class name with search underscore subtitle.

2228
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:46,720
We're going to call this courses dot length to give us the course length and courses available.

2229
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:50,400
All right.

2230
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:58,400
So from here, we're going to do div class name and we're going to do search underscore

2231
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:00,400
content.

2232
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:04,240
And I'm going to go to.

2233
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:07,040
The landing page.

2234
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:10,880
And we're going to go to the course.

2235
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:13,600
Card right here.

2236
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:16,160
Grab this motion div.

2237
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:21,360
Paste it inside our search courses.

2238
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:27,360
Now, of course, is going to cause an error because we need to fix this.

2239
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:28,800
We're not going to have a key for this.

2240
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:32,720
So we're going to start with the opacity of zero.

2241
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:37,360
Why a 40 opacity of one?

2242
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,800
Why have zero over here?

2243
02:37:38,800 --> 02:37:42,960
Transition delay should be zero point two.

2244
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:48,640
And instead of while in view, we're just going to animate.

2245
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:51,200
So we're just going to trigger it right away.

2246
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:54,480
We don't need a viewport for this one.

2247
02:37:54,480 --> 02:38:01,440
And we're just going to give it a class name of search underscore courses dash grid.

2248
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:06,720
And inside here, we're just going to pass in courses dot map.

2249
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:12,000
Pass in a course using arrow function.

2250
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:15,920
And make sure we close it with two.

2251
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:17,840
Parents.

2252
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,320
And a curly brace.

2253
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:25,280
Now, of course, card search is missing a couple of things.

2254
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:29,280
So we're going to say key is equal to course that course ID.

2255
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:36,720
Course is being passed and now we can pass in is selected.

2256
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:41,600
Now, is selected is going to be based on selected course.

2257
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:45,760
Question mark that course ID.

2258
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:52,880
And we're going to check if it's equal to course dot course ID like so.

2259
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:55,680
So if it is the current course, we're going to pass that in.

2260
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:58,960
This is going to be handle course select.

2261
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:02,960
And we're going to pass in course over here.

2262
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:07,280
So now let's make sure we're importing the course card search.

2263
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:13,200
Now, we haven't created handle course select, which is what we are going to do right now.

2264
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:14,960
So we're going to scroll up.

2265
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:21,200
Right after the is loading to make sure the courses already exist.

2266
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,920
So we're going to do handle course select.

2267
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:28,480
We're going to pass in course with a course type.

2268
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:33,360
With an arrow function and we are going to set selected course.

2269
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:34,880
To be the course value.

2270
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:38,160
And we are going to say router dot push.

2271
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,320
So anytime we press the course.

2272
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:42,800
And we pass it.

2273
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:50,240
We are going to go to slash search question mark ID is equal to course.

2274
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:54,080
Dot course ID.

2275
02:39:54,080 --> 02:39:57,280
And we're going to keep it like that.

2276
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:00,320
So if we take a look right now.

2277
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:05,040
What we should see is that anytime let's open it up a little more.

2278
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:10,720
Anytime we select, we are going to see that the ID is being selected over here.

2279
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:15,280
So by the way, if I go over here and I select it.

2280
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:19,120
You should be able to go directly to that selected item.

2281
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:23,520
That's exactly why you should have the state stored in the URL.

2282
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:24,720
Use that state.

2283
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:28,480
That is a reliable source of the state that you can use.

2284
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:34,080
Now, if I were to remove that and go strictly to source or search,

2285
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:36,800
you're going to have the first course being selected.

2286
02:40:36,800 --> 02:40:38,640
All right.

2287
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:43,440
So now let's create the selected option or the selected course viewer on the right side.

2288
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:51,360
So we're first going to create a function called handle enroll now.

2289
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:55,840
So this is just going to be the link that we can pass.

2290
02:40:55,840 --> 02:41:01,280
And this is the URL that we'll go to if someone clicks the enroll now button.

2291
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:03,120
Let's close this out.

2292
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:08,000
So if someone clicks this enroll now, this function is going to be triggered.

2293
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,360
So that's what we're going to create.

2294
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,200
So we're going to do router dot push.

2295
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:17,440
And we're going to set slash check out question mark.

2296
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:18,960
Step is equal to one.

2297
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:24,160
And I'll cover this very shortly when we do the next step.

2298
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:27,120
This is very shortly when we do the checkout flow.

2299
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:31,600
But for now, we're just going to keep it like this.

2300
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:38,080
We're going to have course ID and show sign up is equal to false.

2301
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:42,800
So we're going to have that function.

2302
02:41:42,800 --> 02:41:44,160
But now we can go down.

2303
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:50,720
And below the first motion div, we are going to say selected course.

2304
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:57,360
If that exists, we are going to grab a motion div.

2305
02:41:57,360 --> 02:41:59,200
We're just going to copy this over here.

2306
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:01,840
Paste it.

2307
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:05,840
Make sure we close the motion dot div.

2308
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:10,400
And we're going to make a few adjustments, the duration and the delay.

2309
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:13,920
The delay should be 0.5 seconds.

2310
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:15,280
So it happens after.

2311
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:20,240
And we're going to change the class name to be selected course.

2312
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:26,000
Now, when you do animations, it's very nice to have like a slight delay for the second part.

2313
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:29,360
So this first animates in.

2314
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:33,280
If you see, let's refresh.

2315
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,520
You're going to see that happen.

2316
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:37,120
And then you see this one coming right now.

2317
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:40,240
There's no there's no height because we haven't put anything in.

2318
02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,800
But that's how the animation should happen.

2319
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:43,840
It's a very nice way.

2320
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,000
It's a pleasing effect for the eye.

2321
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,920
If something comes in sequentially.

2322
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:51,760
A few seconds later or like half a second later, basically.

2323
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:58,400
And now what we need to do is we're going to create like a selected course,

2324
02:42:58,400 --> 02:43:01,360
kind of like a card, basically just like a viewer.

2325
02:43:01,360 --> 02:43:03,200
One more time.

2326
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,000
Make sure we capitalize it.

2327
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,280
And what we're going to pass in over here is going to be the course,

2328
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:11,760
like the selected course, so we can use that information.

2329
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:16,560
And then also we're going to pass in the handle enrolled now,

2330
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:19,520
as well as the function directly into here.

2331
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:22,720
Now we just need to create this course.

2332
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:26,720
All right.

2333
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:29,920
So in cases like this, where you have a file structure like this,

2334
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:34,720
selected course is not going to be reused in any other place.

2335
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:39,600
So in this situation, generally you create a new file and you just put

2336
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:44,880
select selected course.tsx.

2337
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:49,600
So you can put the component directly right there and it's very convenient.

2338
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:56,320
So I'm going to do RFCE, start up the selected course.

2339
02:43:56,320 --> 02:44:03,280
And inside here, we're going to pass in course with handle enroll now,

2340
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:05,920
colon props.

2341
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:08,720
We're going to do selected course props like so.

2342
02:44:10,480 --> 02:44:15,520
Inside here, I'm going to pass in class name as we normally do with selected

2343
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:18,000
dash course.

2344
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,440
Inside here, I'm going to give it a div,

2345
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:25,680
remove the text like so.

2346
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:29,920
And we're going to pass in H3 with the class name

2347
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:35,520
of selected course underscore title

2348
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:40,560
and course dot title like this.

2349
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:47,680
And what I want to do is in the search page, we're now going to import that correctly.

2350
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,760
Make sure we save it.

2351
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:54,320
Make sure we see what we're supposed to.

2352
02:44:54,320 --> 02:44:55,280
So we have this.

2353
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:57,040
We just have the title right now.

2354
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:58,880
So we're going to be adding the rest.

2355
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:03,280
From here, we're going to have a P tag.

2356
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:08,000
We're going to say class name is equal to selected dash course.

2357
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,840
And we're just going to copy it because we're going to constantly use that.

2358
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:15,200
And we're going to say author.

2359
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:18,240
This should be double underscore.

2360
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:19,760
Close this out.

2361
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:27,680
And we can just do by course dot teacher name.

2362
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:31,760
And we're going to put like a little horizontal line.

2363
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:37,360
Put an empty space and put a span over here.

2364
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:39,360
So it's styled differently.

2365
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:46,000
Pass in selected course, enroll mid dot count like so.

2366
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:53,760
And we're going to pass in course dot enrollments, question mark dot length.

2367
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:58,480
All right, that's good.

2368
02:45:58,480 --> 02:46:01,440
I'm going to copy the class name like this.

2369
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:03,920
So we don't have to rewrite this every single time.

2370
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:11,520
And then right below the first div, first closing div,

2371
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:18,080
we're going to do class name selected course content like so.

2372
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:23,200
Put a P tag, pass the selected course with description.

2373
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:30,240
And we're going to do course dot description like this with a P tag.

2374
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:35,600
And over here, we're going to do div class name selected course sections.

2375
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:38,240
Close that out.

2376
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:42,960
Put in h4 sections dash title.

2377
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:45,760
We're going to put course content.

2378
02:46:45,760 --> 02:46:58,880
And then over here, we're going to create a separate component called accordion sections.

2379
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:02,640
Now we'll come back to it because we are going to create a separate component

2380
02:47:02,640 --> 02:47:07,600
because we'll be reusing this accordion sections in multiple places in the application.

2381
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:11,600
But for now, let's continue on finishing this card.

2382
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:17,440
So class name selected should be further for this part.

2383
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:20,960
We're going to do a span.

2384
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:22,720
This should show the price.

2385
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,800
We're going to bring in format price from our utils.

2386
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:31,520
So like we did before with the pricing,

2387
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:37,200
it's nice to have a util function that grabs the price, makes everything easy.

2388
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:42,800
And then here, we are going to import from shadcn add components UI button.

2389
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:46,800
And in here, we're going to pass in on click,

2390
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:51,280
pass in the handle enroll now function that we created,

2391
02:47:52,640 --> 02:48:01,360
pass in course with course ID, pass in the class name of BG primary 700,

2392
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:05,280
hover background primary 600.

2393
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:07,760
So in this case, we don't really have a class for that.

2394
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:11,280
And we can just pass in enroll now.

2395
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:19,840
So you should see we have the title, we have the author and the course number of people enrolled,

2396
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:24,640
description, course content, price, and the enroll now button.

2397
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:30,560
So now we're going to have the accordion sections, as you can see here, this is pretty nice.

2398
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:34,800
It's going to animate in and out very smooth.

2399
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:37,120
And we'll be able to show all the sections.

2400
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:40,880
Now, because we're using this and reusing this in multiple places,

2401
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:46,800
we can create this accordion sections component in multiple places.

2402
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:48,400
So let's start by creating this.

2403
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:57,360
We're going to say accordion sections, we're going to pass in sections,

2404
02:48:57,360 --> 02:49:01,120
which is the course dot sections like so.

2405
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:04,640
We haven't created this.

2406
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:12,560
So we're going to go down to components, create a new file, accordion sections, that TSX.

2407
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:23,600
And over here, I'm going to do RAFCE, have the accordion sections displayed like that.

2408
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:33,840
Inside here, I'm going to pass the sections in, we're going to give it accordion sections,

2409
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:36,720
props, like so.

2410
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:40,640
And there should be a colon over here.

2411
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:46,160
And what we're going to use is ShadCN's accordion.

2412
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:47,680
So we've already installed that.

2413
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:53,840
So instead of this being a div, we're going to pass in accordion,

2414
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:58,720
which doesn't seem to be triggering correctly.

2415
02:49:58,720 --> 02:50:01,920
It's not the Radix UI we want.

2416
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:20,480
We want to import accordion from at slash components slash UI slash accordion, like so.

2417
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:29,200
I'm not exactly sure why the IntelliSense is not grabbing the information earlier.

2418
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:36,960
So accordion should be item and accordion trigger as well.

2419
02:50:36,960 --> 02:50:47,840
So over here, we need to set type to be multiple with the class name of width being full.

2420
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:53,600
So it takes up the entire space.

2421
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:58,320
So in here, since we're passing in the sections, we need to create

2422
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:05,760
each sections, we're going to map it out, pass the section in, use an arrow function like this.

2423
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:16,640
And inside here, we're going to do accordion item, pass in a key with section dot section ID.

2424
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:29,760
With value section dot section title and class name of accordion dash section.

2425
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,760
Close this out.

2426
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:39,360
And inside here, we're going to have the accordion trigger, which is basically what it looks like

2427
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:42,400
before you open it up for each item.

2428
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:52,480
We're going to give it a class name of accordion dash section double underscore trigger, like so.

2429
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:57,040
So I'm going to copy this once again to make our lives easier.

2430
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:04,080
And inside here, I'm going to do H5 with accordion section title.

2431
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:06,240
Like so.

2432
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:11,280
We're going to pass in section dot section title.

2433
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,600
Let's see if this works out.

2434
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,920
So we have some linting errors.

2435
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:20,880
So I'm going to close this out like this.

2436
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:23,360
So make sure you have double closing parens.

2437
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:24,960
And we're going to go over here.

2438
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:28,160
We're going to pass in the linter.

2439
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:30,080
Make sure you are importing that.

2440
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:32,960
And let's see if it actually displays something so far.

2441
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:35,200
Yep, there we go.

2442
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:36,320
We have the titles.

2443
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:39,920
That's what the accordion trigger is doing with the accordion item.

2444
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:45,920
But we actually need accordion content to show what's going to happen when you open it.

2445
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:49,360
So I'm going to pass in accordion section.

2446
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:52,320
But this time, it'll be content like so.

2447
02:52:52,320 --> 02:53:00,640
And inside here, we're going to have a UL tag with section dot chapters dot map.

2448
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:05,280
And we're going to pass in chapter, have an arrow function.

2449
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:12,160
And inside here, we're going to have a list item with key chapter dot chapter ID.

2450
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:14,100
Like so.

2451
02:53:14,100 --> 02:53:16,880
Pass in class name.

2452
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:21,200
Actually, we can just paste what we had before with chapter.

2453
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:22,720
Close that up.

2454
02:53:22,720 --> 02:53:29,600
Bring in file text, which is an icon, just so it looks a little better.

2455
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:34,880
We have class name with margin right of two with a four, height of four.

2456
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:36,880
And we're going to make sure we close that.

2457
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:44,000
And finally, we're going to have a span with class name text small.

2458
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:48,160
And put chapter title like so.

2459
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:56,640
And now we should be able to see the opening and closing of these accordions.

2460
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,560
That's pretty nice.

2461
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,240
All right.

2462
02:54:00,240 --> 02:54:04,320
So the next thing we're going to be setting up is going to be authentication.

2463
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:07,840
So we're going to be using clerk authentication.

2464
02:54:07,840 --> 02:54:11,200
So clerk is a very nice managed authentication that makes

2465
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:16,640
auth a lot easier and provides a lot of components and a lot of pre-made

2466
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:22,880
assets that you can use to set up your application and provide auth and keys.

2467
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:28,720
So if you take a look, here is our screenshots of the auth pages.

2468
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:33,760
So these components are basically pre-made components that clerk provides.

2469
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:38,080
And it makes it a lot easier because if you use one of these components,

2470
02:54:38,080 --> 02:54:42,240
it is pre-made with best practices built in.

2471
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:46,160
And all we have to do is style it a little bit with like different colors.

2472
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:51,040
And from there, you can let clerk take care of the rest.

2473
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:54,800
So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a clerk account.

2474
02:54:54,800 --> 02:54:59,200
So you can go to the clerk page and set up your account.

2475
02:54:59,200 --> 02:55:02,240
So when you're signed in, you can probably create an application.

2476
02:55:02,240 --> 02:55:07,120
This might look a little different because I've already created an application.

2477
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:10,800
So you would choose one of these options and you would choose

2478
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:14,320
all the settings that you want for your application.

2479
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:19,920
In our case, we just need email and basically GitHub and Google.

2480
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:21,920
So a couple of those are perfect.

2481
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:25,440
So now I've already created it, but you can create your application.

2482
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:29,920
So if I go over here, this is what you'll see with application.

2483
02:55:29,920 --> 02:55:34,720
And you can go to the configure setting and you can see the settings that you have.

2484
02:55:34,720 --> 02:55:38,240
And you can check for authentication strategies.

2485
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:42,720
Basically, I have email address with phone number canceled.

2486
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:44,560
Username is not allowed.

2487
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:50,160
So we're just going to use emails with password and you can have email verification code.

2488
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:55,120
So a lot of these configurations make it super easy for us to set up our authentication.

2489
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:58,640
So the main thing we want to look at is the API keys.

2490
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:04,720
So over here, you can see that we have a publishable key and a secret key.

2491
02:56:04,720 --> 02:56:06,880
So right now, I'm just going to add a test key.

2492
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:09,200
So at the very end, I'm just going to delete this.

2493
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:15,200
But once we hit a create secret key, we're going to have this test key over here.

2494
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:16,400
I'm just going to copy this.

2495
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:19,200
You're never going to be able to see this once again.

2496
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:21,520
Actually, you can.

2497
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:22,480
You can see it.

2498
02:56:22,480 --> 02:56:25,200
But if you want to delete it, you can delete it.

2499
02:56:26,080 --> 02:56:33,120
So basically, I hit the copy and what we want to do is in our application, we're going to go.

2500
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:38,400
Let's close all of this inside our dot EMV dot local.

2501
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:46,560
I'm going to create next public clerk publishable key.

2502
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:56,000
And also clerk underscore secret underscore key.

2503
02:56:56,800 --> 02:57:03,440
So I'm just going to paste my secret key, but I'm also going to copy and paste my publishable key.

2504
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:05,600
And I'm going to save those.

2505
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:09,440
This will be important for us to use the sign in.

2506
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:13,920
Clerk is going to need these values when you're using it.

2507
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:15,520
All right.

2508
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:19,840
So now from here, they have a next quick start.

2509
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:24,400
You can go in the link in the description if you want to follow this along.

2510
02:57:26,160 --> 02:57:30,720
There is multiple steps to it, but we're going to I'm going to walk you through every step.

2511
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:38,480
So the first thing we're going to do is open up our terminal, close out our client server.

2512
02:57:38,480 --> 02:57:51,600
And we are going to run NPM I at clerk slash next JS and then at clerk slash clerk JS.

2513
02:57:51,600 --> 02:58:02,160
We'll be using this later and also at clerk slash theme and finally next dash themes.

2514
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:07,040
So we are installing the clerk like we did or like it shows us in clerk,

2515
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:11,520
but we are also adding themes because we're going to need those to style our

2516
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,760
component a little bit easier.

2517
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:22,000
And also, you got to remember, we got to do legacy dash peer dash D E P S.

2518
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,000
And from here, I'm going to run NPM run dev once again.

2519
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:31,840
Not that it really matters right now, but we are going to go close all of this out

2520
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:39,360
and go to layout the main layout over here where we have the providers.

2521
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:44,720
And we are going to wrap everything with the clerk provider.

2522
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:50,960
So I'm going to put this around the HTML tag and I'm going to import

2523
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:58,400
clerk provider from at clerk next JS.

2524
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:04,640
This will provide us with the authentication and all the state that clerk provides

2525
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:06,480
and makes it easier for us to use.

2526
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:14,640
Now there is a middleware file that determines the routes that it basically

2527
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:16,880
protects certain routes that we can configure.

2528
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:27,680
So let's go to, let's go to this, this page right here where we see our entire application.

2529
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:32,640
What I want to show you is the flow of the page.

2530
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:42,400
So right here, these, these pages right here don't require authentication.

2531
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:49,200
Actually these two right here do, but these five do not require authentication.

2532
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:56,960
Whereas all of these with the user pages and the teacher pages and the second two

2533
02:59:56,960 --> 03:00:00,400
pages of the checkout that requires authentication.

2534
03:00:01,680 --> 03:00:04,720
And furthermore, we have user pages right here.

2535
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:10,880
These are all the dashboard pages, but this is specifically for users, people who watch the course.

2536
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:13,760
But we also have a different type of role.

2537
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:16,880
And that's going to be the teachers.

2538
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:23,040
These teachers will be able to create the course and they have a different set of pages,

2539
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:28,080
different configurations that they will get to see if they are a teacher role.

2540
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:34,080
So essentially we need to configure this so that certain pages have that authentication

2541
03:00:34,080 --> 03:00:38,080
and make sure that they are authenticated to go to those pages.

2542
03:00:38,080 --> 03:00:41,280
And that's exactly what the middleware file is going to be for.

2543
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:48,320
So to do this, I'm going to close out the layout and inside the source directory, like

2544
03:00:48,320 --> 03:00:55,200
on the outside, we're going to create a new file called middleware.ts.

2545
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:59,040
And we are going to do a number of things.

2546
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:07,680
So I'm going to import clerk middleware and we're going to import create route

2547
03:01:07,680 --> 03:01:15,280
matcher from @clerk/nextjs/server.

2548
03:01:15,280 --> 03:01:23,280
And then we're also going to import next response from next/server.

2549
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:29,280
Over here, I'm going to say is student route.

2550
03:01:29,280 --> 03:01:32,960
So this will determine all the routes that are specifically for students.

2551
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:38,560
And we're going to use the create route matcher pass in in the array

2552
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:44,080
with string/user/parens.n*.

2553
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:50,800
And we're going to close this out like that.

2554
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:54,880
And we're also going to create is teacher route.

2555
03:01:55,280 --> 03:01:58,080
Which is going to be similar.

2556
03:01:58,080 --> 03:02:02,960
So we're just going to paste that, except this is going to involve teacher.

2557
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:08,720
So essentially, anytime, well, basically these routes is going to have the /user

2558
03:02:08,720 --> 03:02:14,640
as part of the URL and the other ones are going to be /teacher.

2559
03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:18,800
So we're going to make sure we route match those.

2560
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:23,680
And to do this, we're going to use clerk middleware.

2561
03:02:25,280 --> 03:02:30,080
And we're going to use an async function with auth rec.

2562
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:32,000
And we're going to have an arrow function.

2563
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:36,880
And we're going to grab session claims like this.

2564
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:39,760
And we're going to await the authentication.

2565
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:49,920
And we're going to set user role is going to be session claims?metadata.

2566
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:56,640
We're going to be storing our user type, basically whether they are a student or teacher

2567
03:02:56,640 --> 03:02:59,040
in the metadata.

2568
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,720
And we'll cover that very shortly and how this will work.

2569
03:03:02,720 --> 03:03:11,680
But we're going to set as user type, it's going to be either student or teacher like this.

2570
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:20,400
And we're going to do .user type student.

2571
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:25,920
Student is will be the default user type if there is no value.

2572
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:33,680
So if is student route, we're going to pass in rec.

2573
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:41,200
So if user role does not equal to student.

2574
03:03:41,200 --> 03:03:46,400
And by the way, all of this has documentation on clerk.

2575
03:03:46,400 --> 03:03:49,840
So you can go in depth of how all of this works.

2576
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:57,600
But over here, we're going to say if the URL, let's say new URL should be slash teacher

2577
03:03:57,600 --> 03:04:00,720
slash courses rec.url.

2578
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:04,720
We're going to return a next response.

2579
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:09,760
And we're going to redirect them to the correct URL.

2580
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:14,160
So basically, we're just checking if it's a student route.

2581
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:18,320
And if the user role is not student, we're going to redirect them to the teacher.

2582
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,880
Otherwise, if it is teacher route, like so.

2583
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:31,520
And if the user role is not equal to teacher, we're going to pass in the user.

2584
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:35,040
We're essentially redirecting the user to the right location.

2585
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:41,680
And we're just handling this all in clerk middleware, which makes it very nice and easy to do.

2586
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:46,720
So over here, I'm going to do export const with config.

2587
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:51,520
And we're going to set the matcher to be an array.

2588
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:58,240
And over here in the clerk setup, I'm not going to type all of this out.

2589
03:04:58,240 --> 03:05:03,600
But right here, we're just going to grab this inside the matcher.

2590
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:06,640
And we could just save it.

2591
03:05:06,640 --> 03:05:12,720
So with that, we basically have our user routes redirecting to the proper location.

2592
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:16,320
Now, we have not created the user roles and we have not set that up.

2593
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:22,080
But before we get to that, let's actually create the sign in and sign up components.

2594
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:22,320
All right.

2595
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:27,200
So I want to take your attention to the clerk docs components page.

2596
03:05:27,200 --> 03:05:29,760
So over here, there's a lot going on.

2597
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:32,240
We started with Next.js full stack.

2598
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:34,240
We have a documentation on those.

2599
03:05:34,240 --> 03:05:38,800
But over here, this is where we are going to use UI components.

2600
03:05:38,800 --> 03:05:44,640
So the components that we're going to be using is going to include sign in, sign up,

2601
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:48,320
user button, and user profile.

2602
03:05:48,320 --> 03:05:54,880
So these are much more pre-made components that already have a specific look and a styling.

2603
03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:57,440
And it provides all the functionality you need.

2604
03:05:57,440 --> 03:06:05,440
If you are ever curious about what properties are needed, it's all documented pretty well

2605
03:06:05,440 --> 03:06:07,040
in their documentation.

2606
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:10,240
Sign in and sign up are slightly different.

2607
03:06:10,240 --> 03:06:16,080
And then user button includes the little, you know, the navigation at the top over here,

2608
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,120
for example, like this.

2609
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:19,360
Those are user button.

2610
03:06:19,360 --> 03:06:21,360
User profile looks a little bit different.

2611
03:06:21,360 --> 03:06:26,320
But this is how you can configure the setup in clerk.

2612
03:06:26,320 --> 03:06:28,160
And you don't have to create these components.

2613
03:06:28,160 --> 03:06:30,640
It makes it a lot easier.

2614
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:36,960
Now, just FYI, there is an alternative option called elements.

2615
03:06:36,960 --> 03:06:44,560
So this is if you really want to customize your flow for, you know, like very, very customized

2616
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:45,200
components.

2617
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:47,120
But it is in beta.

2618
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:51,520
And it is much more safer to be able to use one of these authentication components.

2619
03:06:51,520 --> 03:06:57,760
And then we would use these components and style them using the appearance prop, which

2620
03:06:57,760 --> 03:06:58,880
is located over here.

2621
03:06:58,880 --> 03:07:01,920
And I will cover that as we go along.

2622
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:08,080
So with that, let's actually start creating our sign in components.

2623
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:12,240
So because we're going to be using the sign in component in a couple places, I'm going

2624
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:13,680
to create a new file.

2625
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:17,680
I'm going to call it sign in dot TSX.

2626
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:21,440
And over here, I'm going to start by doing RFCE.

2627
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:23,280
And we're going to have sign in.

2628
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:27,040
I'm going to call this sign in sign in component like this.

2629
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:34,560
And inside our div, instead of a div right here, I'm going to use sign in from at clerk

2630
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:34,800
next.

2631
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:39,440
Yes, I'm going to save it like this and use it like this.

2632
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:43,280
And then from here, this is not actually using the components.

2633
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:47,360
So we're going to go to our app page and we're going to create a new folder.

2634
03:07:47,360 --> 03:07:51,280
And we're going to call this inside this off component.

2635
03:07:51,280 --> 03:07:52,720
I'm going to create a new folder.

2636
03:07:52,720 --> 03:07:54,320
I'm going to call this sign in.

2637
03:07:54,960 --> 03:08:00,320
And for using clerk, we have to use a catch all folder.

2638
03:08:00,320 --> 03:08:10,640
So that is done via creating another folder dot sign in with double bracket friends.

2639
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:14,000
That's the way for this to work.

2640
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:18,080
And we need to create a component or a page dot TSX.

2641
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:21,520
So we have a sign in page by itself.

2642
03:08:21,520 --> 03:08:25,680
So if I look at the final application, let's sign out.

2643
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:28,800
And if you go log in, you're going to see this separate page.

2644
03:08:28,800 --> 03:08:32,320
And that is the clerk authentication component.

2645
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:35,600
So in here, it's going to be very simple.

2646
03:08:35,600 --> 03:08:39,520
I'm just going to do export default function page.

2647
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:44,480
And we're just going to return sign in like so.

2648
03:08:44,480 --> 03:08:48,960
And we are going to import it from at component sign in.

2649
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:50,960
So it's basically the component page.

2650
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:57,040
So with that, let's actually look if we have this particular file.

2651
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:58,560
So we're going to say sign in.

2652
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:03,920
And we should be able to see we have the sign in component exactly what we expect.

2653
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:08,000
And this is very nice because setting this up is pretty annoying

2654
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:12,640
and can be very complicated and cause security issues if we do not do it correctly.

2655
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:16,480
However, this is not the styling that we kind of want.

2656
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:24,080
So the first thing I want to do is in this auth folder, I'm going to create a new layout.tsx.

2657
03:09:24,080 --> 03:09:36,240
So this will determine the layout for our page, specifically for the authentication pages.

2658
03:09:36,240 --> 03:09:39,120
So I'm going to do rafce.

2659
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:46,320
I'm going to call this layout with a capital L inside here.

2660
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:48,000
I'm going to pass in children.

2661
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:58,160
And over here would be children in curly braces, colon react.react node.

2662
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:05,680
And over here, I'm going to do div class name, pass in auth-layout

2663
03:10:07,920 --> 03:10:16,720
with another main class name, auth-layout_main, like so.

2664
03:10:16,720 --> 03:10:19,920
Make sure we close that out.

2665
03:10:19,920 --> 03:10:24,240
And we also close out our main element.

2666
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:29,200
And inside here, this should be children, like so.

2667
03:10:29,200 --> 03:10:34,400
And so now this should be centered and right in the right,

2668
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:36,960
basically in the right spot that we want.

2669
03:10:38,320 --> 03:10:43,440
So pretty simple, but we also want to be able to style this appropriately.

2670
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:46,240
So we're going to go back to our sign-in component.

2671
03:10:46,240 --> 03:10:50,640
And what we want is to deal with the appearance prop.

2672
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:56,960
So appearance prop is where we can style it very well.

2673
03:10:56,960 --> 03:11:00,800
So the first thing we want to do is give it a base theme of dark.

2674
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:02,960
So this makes it easier for us to style.

2675
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:07,360
We can customize it without using this, but this makes it a lot easier.

2676
03:11:07,360 --> 03:11:19,040
So the dark variable is going to come from import dark from @clerk/themes.

2677
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:25,920
So that gives us the dark color, but this is not perfectly in brand with the colors.

2678
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:27,920
So we're going to customize this quite a bit.

2679
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:31,920
And the way we customize it is pretty simple and interesting.

2680
03:11:31,920 --> 03:11:37,920
So if I open this up, like so, I'm going to click some of these elements.

2681
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:44,320
And the way you basically style this is that you take one of these CSS elements

2682
03:11:44,320 --> 03:11:47,600
and you can see the classes that are placed on it.

2683
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:49,520
So CLFormField.

2684
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:52,400
Let's say we want to modify the form field.

2685
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:54,880
Or actually, let's look at...

2686
03:11:54,880 --> 03:11:59,280
So let's say we want to modify this text right here.

2687
03:11:59,280 --> 03:12:02,640
You can see that we have a class of CLFormField label.

2688
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:07,840
There's an easy way to style this and we can use the elements property.

2689
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:16,960
Pass in an object and we can write form field label like so with colon.

2690
03:12:16,960 --> 03:12:21,600
And then from here, we can actually just pass in tailwind classes.

2691
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:25,440
So I'm going to do text white of 50 and font normal.

2692
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:30,560
Now, if you take a look, it's no longer super white.

2693
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:33,680
It is a normal font and it's no longer bolded.

2694
03:12:33,680 --> 03:12:39,600
So it's very nice to be able to style this using their classes over here.

2695
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:42,800
So you can directly style it using all the classes.

2696
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:45,600
So I'm going to go through this pretty quick.

2697
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:50,480
The first thing we want to style is going to be flex or root box.

2698
03:12:51,360 --> 03:12:57,360
Justify dash center items, dash center with py of five.

2699
03:12:57,360 --> 03:13:04,560
We're going to give it a card box and we're going to give it a shadow of none.

2700
03:13:04,560 --> 03:13:08,320
So there's no shadows.

2701
03:13:08,320 --> 03:13:11,200
We don't want any kind of border because that's not part of our style.

2702
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:16,400
And for the card, we're going to give it a background of custom grays,

2703
03:13:16,400 --> 03:13:19,120
which is a color I have specifically set.

2704
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:25,760
Secondary PG with a full and a shadow of none.

2705
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:29,680
So the color in the background is now different.

2706
03:13:29,680 --> 03:13:33,520
Now, we also want to style the further a bit.

2707
03:13:33,520 --> 03:13:39,520
So, again, you can find the class elements.

2708
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:43,280
So like this, this would be the further CL further.

2709
03:13:43,280 --> 03:13:45,360
That's exactly what I'm styling right here.

2710
03:13:46,800 --> 03:13:50,560
In here, I'm going to give it a background of this specific color,

2711
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:55,360
25262F because that's what matches.

2712
03:13:55,360 --> 03:13:59,200
We're going to give it a padding of 0rem, 2.5rem.

2713
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:04,240
And we're also going to target very inside.

2714
03:14:04,240 --> 03:14:10,080
I did a lot of experiments just to make sure we're grabbing the correct selectors.

2715
03:14:10,080 --> 03:14:12,400
And you can kind of do it like this.

2716
03:14:14,240 --> 03:14:19,520
We want to give this a background color of 25262F.

2717
03:14:19,520 --> 03:14:26,080
Once we have that, we're going to have a more homogenous color right there, which is perfect.

2718
03:14:26,080 --> 03:14:30,160
And below this, we're going to have form button primary.

2719
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,800
So we're going to change the main button color.

2720
03:14:32,800 --> 03:14:38,720
Even though white looks pretty nice, it is not consistent with what we have with the other colors.

2721
03:14:39,680 --> 03:14:52,560
So we're going to do bg custom grays primary bg text of white 50 shadow of none.

2722
03:14:52,560 --> 03:15:07,120
And then form field input colon bg custom grays primary bg text of white 50.

2723
03:15:07,120 --> 03:15:09,040
And we are doing shadow of none.

2724
03:15:09,680 --> 03:15:12,720
By the way, this exclamation means it's an important tag.

2725
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:16,400
Sometimes you need to do that to override certain classes.

2726
03:15:16,400 --> 03:15:20,320
And we're also going to change the further action link styling.

2727
03:15:20,320 --> 03:15:28,400
So we're going to do text primary 750 hover text primary 600.

2728
03:15:28,400 --> 03:15:29,440
We're going to save that.

2729
03:15:29,440 --> 03:15:33,920
And it does seem like I did mess up the primary.

2730
03:15:33,920 --> 03:15:36,960
This should not be this set.

2731
03:15:36,960 --> 03:15:39,200
So we're going to remove text white 50.

2732
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:50,000
And we're going to change this to primary 700 like so text of white 100 and hover background

2733
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,960
primary 600 like that.

2734
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:57,440
That should give us our little button.

2735
03:15:57,440 --> 03:16:02,320
And we have our styling just as we this is quite good.

2736
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:05,040
But now we need to do this sign up component.

2737
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:10,400
So we're going to handle all the redirects and where things should go where.

2738
03:16:10,400 --> 03:16:14,320
But let's first create the sign up component.

2739
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:17,440
So I'm going to close this out like this.

2740
03:16:17,440 --> 03:16:19,440
So we have more space.

2741
03:16:19,440 --> 03:16:25,920
I'm going to open this up, create a new component called sign up TSX.

2742
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:32,400
And I'm just going to take everything in our sign in component, paste it over here.

2743
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:40,880
But we're going to change sign in command the four times and changes to sign up like this.

2744
03:16:40,880 --> 03:16:46,000
And from here, we also want to create another folder.

2745
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:55,760
We're going to have sign up passing another folder with double brackets, three dots sign

2746
03:16:55,760 --> 03:17:01,680
up to closing braces just like that.

2747
03:17:02,480 --> 03:17:06,320
And we're going to create another file called page TSX.

2748
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:14,080
And we're going to go to our sign in page, we're going to copy that, paste it over here.

2749
03:17:14,080 --> 03:17:20,000
Change the sign in to sign up.

2750
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:28,640
And now we can now go directly to the URL, go sign up.

2751
03:17:30,320 --> 03:17:34,640
And we should be able to see the exact same thing, but this is a sign up component.

2752
03:17:34,640 --> 03:17:36,800
Perfect.

2753
03:17:36,800 --> 03:17:38,960
So this makes it super easy.

2754
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:44,960
We have the sign up component, we have all the appearance consistent with our styling,

2755
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:47,200
and we have all our settings perfectly done.

2756
03:17:47,200 --> 03:17:55,200
And by the way, all the configurations we did, we had password, email verification name.

2757
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:57,680
I also clicked name right here.

2758
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:03,920
So maybe if you didn't change the setting, you wouldn't see the first name, last name

2759
03:18:03,920 --> 03:18:06,400
required over here for creating your account.

2760
03:18:06,400 --> 03:18:11,840
So it makes it super easy when we use the sign in sign up component and we configure

2761
03:18:11,840 --> 03:18:17,040
it over here on clerk's dashboard, which makes it so convenient and so nice.

2762
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:21,680
So while we have that, we don't have some of the links right here.

2763
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:25,200
So if you take a look, the sign in, it's not going to take us to the right page.

2764
03:18:25,200 --> 03:18:28,880
If you look at the bottom left, that's the page where it's supposed to take you.

2765
03:18:28,880 --> 03:18:33,440
That's the default location, but we want to take it, take us to the sign in page.

2766
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:36,080
So let's take a look at our diagram.

2767
03:18:36,080 --> 03:18:39,600
We're going to go to this particular page.

2768
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:45,920
So authentication flow right here is how the screen flows are going to work.

2769
03:18:45,920 --> 03:18:50,640
So in the nav bar, we're going to have a login and sign up.

2770
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:54,800
The login is going to take us to the sign in page.

2771
03:18:54,800 --> 03:18:58,000
The sign up will take us to the sign up page.

2772
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,160
Pretty straightforward.

2773
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:04,480
And then we're going to have the sign up page take us to the sign up page or sign in

2774
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:09,280
sign up text button, and then the sign in text button to the sign in page.

2775
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:11,280
So we're going to have to configure that.

2776
03:19:11,280 --> 03:19:20,000
And then also in our checkout or guest checkout, we'll cover this later, but we're going to

2777
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:23,040
have to handle this logic with our authentication flow.

2778
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:27,920
The step one requires us to sign in.

2779
03:19:27,920 --> 03:19:32,080
We're ignoring the guest checkout because the scope was a little big.

2780
03:19:32,080 --> 03:19:36,320
We're ignoring guest checkout, and we're going to make sure that the user needs to

2781
03:19:36,320 --> 03:19:41,040
sign in and sign up before they can go to the payment checkout page.

2782
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:46,720
So we'll have this sign in component over here.

2783
03:19:47,920 --> 03:19:51,680
And they can only then go to this page if they signed up.

2784
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:56,800
So if they are signed in, we're going to take them to this payment page directly.

2785
03:19:56,800 --> 03:20:01,040
So that means that the user has already signed in, then they could go to this page.

2786
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:04,160
So these are all configurations that we need to set.

2787
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:07,200
And one last thing is right here.

2788
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:11,760
Once you open the little user button, we have manage account.

2789
03:20:11,760 --> 03:20:16,400
So if we go to the manage account, we're going to use the user profile account.

2790
03:20:16,400 --> 03:20:18,320
So this is within the dashboard page.

2791
03:20:18,320 --> 03:20:20,560
So this is when they're authenticated.

2792
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:25,120
It's going to take them to this particular page so they can configure the settings for

2793
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:26,160
their user profile.

2794
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:34,880
But also, if they click sign out, it's going to automatically transfer them to the landing page.

2795
03:20:34,880 --> 03:20:39,840
So this is basically all the directions that we need to set Clerk to do.

2796
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:45,200
So there's a few route considerations that we're going to have to set up in these components.

2797
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:53,200
So the sign in page includes two situations.

2798
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:57,600
We have the auth page where they're just going to sign in.

2799
03:20:57,600 --> 03:21:02,000
But then there's also the checkout page where they can sign in there as well.

2800
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:04,400
But we have different considerations when they sign in.

2801
03:21:04,400 --> 03:21:09,680
And the redirect is going to be different based on whether they signed in over here

2802
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:12,320
or whether they signed in over here.

2803
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:16,160
So the redirect URLs are going to be different.

2804
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:18,640
And we need to figure out how to set that up.

2805
03:21:18,640 --> 03:21:23,040
So what we are going to do is we're going to grab search params.

2806
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:28,640
So we are grabbing from the URL and we're going to use next slash navigation.

2807
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:35,680
And then we're also going to grab the user information, which is using use user from

2808
03:21:35,680 --> 03:21:40,560
clerk so we can use that information as well.

2809
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:44,400
And we are also going to check via the URL route.

2810
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:46,080
Let's put this over here.

2811
03:21:46,080 --> 03:21:56,240
So is checkout page is going to be determined by whether we grab a URL that says show sign up.

2812
03:21:56,240 --> 03:22:02,160
So if this URL consists of show sign up, which is going to happen on the checkout page,

2813
03:22:03,440 --> 03:22:07,200
this page right here, remember the URL is just slash sign in.

2814
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:10,720
So we don't need to, this will return false.

2815
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:16,080
So if it's not equal to null, that means we are at the checkout page.

2816
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:21,760
But if it is null, which you're on this page, this is going to return false.

2817
03:22:21,760 --> 03:22:23,600
So we are not at the checkout page.

2818
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:28,560
So that's how we determine whether we are on this page or this page.

2819
03:22:29,840 --> 03:22:37,360
And then course ID is we are going to grab it from search params dot get dash ID.

2820
03:22:37,360 --> 03:22:41,360
And remember, this is again only going to happen if they're on the checkout page.

2821
03:22:41,360 --> 03:22:47,680
So the way we are going to grab the sign up URL, the reason why we need to sign up URL

2822
03:22:47,680 --> 03:22:49,040
is going to redirect them.

2823
03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:52,960
So basically this button is going to redirect them to this page.

2824
03:22:55,040 --> 03:23:04,160
If we are on this page, otherwise over here, if they click sign up, it's not going to redirect

2825
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:07,200
them to this page.

2826
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:08,560
It's not going to do that.

2827
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:10,320
We want to keep them on the checkout page.

2828
03:23:10,320 --> 03:23:14,800
So this component is going to turn into a sign up component right here.

2829
03:23:14,800 --> 03:23:19,360
So we're not redirecting, we're redirecting them to a new URL.

2830
03:23:19,360 --> 03:23:24,160
We're just going to take them over here and just switch out the components essentially.

2831
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:29,360
So we're going to do is checkout page and we are going to pass in a string.

2832
03:23:29,360 --> 03:23:34,960
If we are on the checkout page, we're going to do checkout question mark step is equal

2833
03:23:34,960 --> 03:23:35,440
to one.

2834
03:23:35,440 --> 03:23:42,000
Given an and variable with and is equal to course ID.

2835
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:47,600
And we are going to do and show sign up is equal to true.

2836
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:53,680
So that means we are going to set this to be a sign up component.

2837
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:58,080
Otherwise, we are just going to take them to the sign up page.

2838
03:23:58,080 --> 03:24:02,400
So with that sign up URL, we're going to go down over here.

2839
03:24:02,400 --> 03:24:06,880
We're going to say sign up URL.

2840
03:24:06,880 --> 03:24:10,960
So that will determine what that sign up URL button goes to.

2841
03:24:10,960 --> 03:24:13,760
And it's going to take us to the right page.

2842
03:24:13,760 --> 03:24:22,720
So if I go to local host and again, this needs to be a use client component because we are

2843
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:25,600
using use search params.

2844
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:30,880
So let's actually start in the sign in page.

2845
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:37,440
We're going to hit sign up and that should take us to this sign up page right here.

2846
03:24:37,440 --> 03:24:42,480
If you look at the URL, it took us from sign in to sign up.

2847
03:24:42,480 --> 03:24:45,200
So I click here, sign up.

2848
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:52,240
Later on, when we are on the checkout page, this will play a role and we're going to take

2849
03:24:52,240 --> 03:24:53,440
us to a different page.

2850
03:24:53,440 --> 03:25:01,440
And then we also need to configure where it takes us once we sign in and sign up.

2851
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:07,680
So we need to figure out what the URL is going to be after the user signs in, signs up, and

2852
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:10,720
it's going to have different scenarios again.

2853
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:14,720
So get redirect URL is a function we're going to need.

2854
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:24,080
So if we are at the is checkout page, we're going to return to slash checkout question

2855
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:26,640
mark step is equal to two.

2856
03:25:26,640 --> 03:25:31,920
And we're going to do ID is equal to course ID like this.

2857
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:43,360
Otherwise, we're going to do different routes depending on whether they are a teacher or

2858
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:44,400
a student.

2859
03:25:44,400 --> 03:25:48,400
So we're going to grab the user type and we're going to use public metadata.

2860
03:25:48,400 --> 03:25:54,800
And we are going to grab the user type, as we mentioned before, which we'll talk about

2861
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:55,280
shortly.

2862
03:25:55,280 --> 03:26:02,720
We're going to do if user type is equal to a teacher, we're going to make sure that they

2863
03:26:02,720 --> 03:26:07,760
go to the URL slash teacher slash courses.

2864
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:15,120
Otherwise, if they're not the user type of teacher, they're going to go to user slash

2865
03:26:15,120 --> 03:26:16,160
courses.

2866
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:24,240
And we are going to need to pass this in via force redirect URL.

2867
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:29,440
We're going to do get redirect URL, invoke that function to get us a string.

2868
03:26:29,440 --> 03:26:36,160
It's a little bit complicated, but that's mostly because we do have two different scenarios

2869
03:26:36,160 --> 03:26:38,320
where we use sign in and sign out.

2870
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:44,080
Finally, we want to set the routing to be a hash.

2871
03:26:44,080 --> 03:26:45,760
Otherwise, all of this won't work.

2872
03:26:45,760 --> 03:26:53,040
And then the after sign out URL, like we mentioned, this is a URL that we go to after they

2873
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:53,920
sign out.

2874
03:26:53,920 --> 03:26:55,520
And that's just going to be the landing page.

2875
03:26:55,520 --> 03:26:57,600
And there we go.

2876
03:26:57,600 --> 03:27:01,120
That's most of what we need for sign in.

2877
03:27:01,120 --> 03:27:04,320
Sign up is going to be very, very similar.

2878
03:27:04,320 --> 03:27:11,520
So if I go to the sign up component, we're just going to basically copy everything in

2879
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:12,020
here.

2880
03:27:12,020 --> 03:27:16,160
We're going to make sure we import everything correctly.

2881
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:21,520
We're going to change the sign up URL to sign in URL.

2882
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:25,200
This show sign up is going to be false.

2883
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:28,640
And this is going to be sign in.

2884
03:27:28,640 --> 03:27:31,920
Now, if you don't understand the checkout, we're going to be talking about that very

2885
03:27:31,920 --> 03:27:32,720
shortly.

2886
03:27:32,720 --> 03:27:33,840
So don't worry about that.

2887
03:27:34,880 --> 03:27:36,640
All of this can remain the same.

2888
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:42,080
And we're going to go back to the sign in component, copy all of this.

2889
03:27:42,080 --> 03:27:47,840
Paces over here, except this should be sign in.

2890
03:27:47,840 --> 03:27:56,880
And this should be pretty much good to go after we add use client at the top.

2891
03:27:56,880 --> 03:28:02,960
So with all of that, we should be able to now create our account.

2892
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:07,360
So I'm just going to give this a dummy account.

2893
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:10,160
So first name is going to be some dumb.

2894
03:28:10,160 --> 03:28:20,160
And then our email address is some dummy email at gmail.com.

2895
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:22,400
I'm just going to do it.

2896
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:26,240
One, two, three, Apple bees for the account.

2897
03:28:26,240 --> 03:28:28,720
We're going to hit continue.

2898
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:32,480
And you're going to have to verify on your email account.

2899
03:28:32,480 --> 03:28:37,680
And over here, I have seven, one, one, eight, two, seven.

2900
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:40,640
And when you succeed, it should take you to user slash courses.

2901
03:28:40,640 --> 03:28:43,040
And we're going to say page could not be found.

2902
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:46,720
That's who we to be expected because we haven't created it.

2903
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:49,760
And we're just going to go back to local host.

2904
03:28:49,760 --> 03:28:55,200
So now if you go to the homepage right here, you won't be able to see if you signed in

2905
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:56,400
or out.

2906
03:28:57,200 --> 03:29:03,360
So if we want to check, we can go to, let's go to the landing page.

2907
03:29:03,360 --> 03:29:06,160
And what we're going to do is go up here.

2908
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:08,160
We're going to remove the console log of courses.

2909
03:29:08,160 --> 03:29:15,440
We don't need those, but we're going to grab user from use user from clerk.

2910
03:29:15,440 --> 03:29:19,360
And we can console log this.

2911
03:29:19,360 --> 03:29:21,440
I'm going to save this.

2912
03:29:21,440 --> 03:29:24,960
Open up our console.

2913
03:29:26,240 --> 03:29:32,000
And you can see we have our user information as has all the details over here.

2914
03:29:32,000 --> 03:29:38,720
So we have the first name, full name, some dumb email address all over here.

2915
03:29:38,720 --> 03:29:42,480
So everything that we need is provided automatically.

2916
03:29:42,480 --> 03:29:44,320
So this is great.

2917
03:29:44,320 --> 03:29:49,200
So that's good for us that we can see that in our console log, but for the user,

2918
03:29:49,200 --> 03:29:52,080
there's no way of them knowing that they're signed in.

2919
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:54,320
So we need to create a user button.

2920
03:29:54,320 --> 03:29:57,760
So again, I'm just going to remove that from the landing page.

2921
03:29:57,760 --> 03:30:03,440
And what we're going to do is we're going to go back finally to our non-dashboard

2922
03:30:03,440 --> 03:30:08,080
nav bar over here, and we are going to add the sign in buttons.

2923
03:30:08,080 --> 03:30:13,280
So the way this works is we're going to use signed in from clerk.

2924
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:20,720
So this is just a situation where this is the condition of whether we are signed in.

2925
03:30:20,720 --> 03:30:28,480
We are going to display the user button component from clerk next JS.

2926
03:30:28,480 --> 03:30:32,000
We're going to display that if we're signed in.

2927
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:36,000
But then you also want to set up the signed out.

2928
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:42,720
So this will show whatever you want over here, what it looks like when they're signed out.

2929
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:49,920
So in here, we're going to have a link with href is equal to slash sign in.

2930
03:30:51,520 --> 03:31:02,240
With the class name of non-dashboard nav bar, double underscore auth dash button dash dash log

2931
03:31:02,240 --> 03:31:02,740
in.

2932
03:31:02,740 --> 03:31:05,760
Pass that in over there.

2933
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:08,400
This is going to be log in like so.

2934
03:31:08,400 --> 03:31:12,960
And then I'm going to copy this, paste it over here.

2935
03:31:12,960 --> 03:31:14,240
We're going to do sign up.

2936
03:31:16,560 --> 03:31:20,560
And this should be instead of log in, sign up.

2937
03:31:20,560 --> 03:31:25,600
And this should be sign up right here as well.

2938
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:27,760
But let's save it.

2939
03:31:27,760 --> 03:31:32,640
And as you can see, we have our user button.

2940
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:36,560
It shows everything and everything is as we expect.

2941
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:40,080
So now this is a little bit jarring because it is light mode.

2942
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:44,000
We want a dark mode and we want to customize this a little bit.

2943
03:31:44,640 --> 03:31:50,240
We also want to display the name or email address if they have it in the user button.

2944
03:31:50,240 --> 03:31:54,000
So the user button is going to require some appearance.

2945
03:31:54,000 --> 03:31:58,160
So we're going to use the appearance prop as well over here.

2946
03:31:58,160 --> 03:32:03,280
We're going to pass in base theme as well.

2947
03:32:03,280 --> 03:32:06,400
So we're going to pass in dark from clerk themes.

2948
03:32:06,400 --> 03:32:09,280
We're going to set elements.

2949
03:32:10,640 --> 03:32:16,400
And we are going to give it some styling user button outer identifier.

2950
03:32:16,400 --> 03:32:23,040
We're going to do text custom, raise dirty gray like this.

2951
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:35,120
And then user button box colon scale of 90 and scale

2952
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:41,040
of 100 on larger screens like so.

2953
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:46,160
And we're also going to pass in a few other props like show name.

2954
03:32:46,160 --> 03:32:49,840
So we just want as pretty self-explanatory.

2955
03:32:49,840 --> 03:32:51,360
We want to have the name shown.

2956
03:32:51,360 --> 03:33:01,120
User profile mode is going to be navigation so that we have user profile use the URL.

2957
03:33:03,920 --> 03:33:08,400
So that will determine basically this manage account URL.

2958
03:33:08,400 --> 03:33:14,880
So if the user role is equal to teacher,

2959
03:33:14,880 --> 03:33:22,720
we're going to pass in slash teacher slash profile.

2960
03:33:22,720 --> 03:33:31,280
Otherwise we're going to pass in slash user profile over here.

2961
03:33:31,920 --> 03:33:35,440
But the user role is not identified.

2962
03:33:35,440 --> 03:33:38,400
So we're going to go scroll all the way to the top.

2963
03:33:38,400 --> 03:33:41,920
And we are going to pass in user.

2964
03:33:41,920 --> 03:33:46,720
Grab use user from at clerk next JS.

2965
03:33:46,720 --> 03:33:57,120
You're going to pass in user role user question mark public meta data question mark user type

2966
03:33:57,760 --> 03:34:03,920
as student or teacher like so.

2967
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:06,160
We're going to set that.

2968
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:10,720
And again, this is now going to be a client component.

2969
03:34:10,720 --> 03:34:13,920
So we're going to do use client over here.

2970
03:34:13,920 --> 03:34:20,000
And now we should see that the name is popping up.

2971
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:21,840
We should see this box.

2972
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:24,560
We should see a darker color.

2973
03:34:24,560 --> 03:34:28,800
And if I click manage account, it's going to take us to the user profile.

2974
03:34:28,800 --> 03:34:32,080
And that's based on this user role.

2975
03:34:32,080 --> 03:34:37,280
By default, we're going to do user profile, which is a user account.

2976
03:34:37,280 --> 03:34:41,440
Now, if I go back to the main oops.

2977
03:34:41,440 --> 03:34:47,200
If I go back to the main page, let's hit sign out.

2978
03:34:47,200 --> 03:34:49,600
It's going to take us to the home page.

2979
03:34:49,600 --> 03:34:52,480
And we are going to see this particular page.

2980
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:55,360
The login takes us to this URL.

2981
03:34:55,360 --> 03:34:58,560
Sign up takes us to the sign up account.

2982
03:34:58,560 --> 03:35:01,200
And it's pretty nice, right?

2983
03:35:01,200 --> 03:35:03,120
So we already have our flows.

2984
03:35:03,120 --> 03:35:07,680
Let's say since we already created our account, we're going to click sign in.

2985
03:35:07,680 --> 03:35:11,280
I'm just going to sign into the account that we created.

2986
03:35:11,280 --> 03:35:13,920
So just some dummy email at gmail.com.

2987
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:18,320
And over here, you can see the password pops up.

2988
03:35:18,320 --> 03:35:21,760
And that makes it super easy to hit continue.

2989
03:35:21,760 --> 03:35:24,080
And that takes us to the user courses again.

2990
03:35:24,080 --> 03:35:25,920
We have not created that page.

2991
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:29,440
So this is perfectly a valid point.

2992
03:35:29,440 --> 03:35:32,400
So authentication is pretty much set.

2993
03:35:32,400 --> 03:35:38,960
Now, the last thing I want to take care of is how do we set the user roles, the user types?

2994
03:35:38,960 --> 03:35:47,360
So I was going to create a separate page for like an admin who determines whether the user

2995
03:35:47,360 --> 03:35:51,680
that signed up is going to be a teacher or a user.

2996
03:35:51,680 --> 03:35:59,040
So that you typically would have some kind of admin person to be able to make a specific

2997
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:02,720
user into a teacher if they wanted to for extra security.

2998
03:36:02,720 --> 03:36:08,320
However, the scope would have been too big.

2999
03:36:08,320 --> 03:36:16,160
So instead, the easiest way to do this is we go, we can look at their users inside our

3000
03:36:16,160 --> 03:36:16,880
clerk.

3001
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:20,400
So you can see that we have our user that signed up.

3002
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:22,400
And we can click on this.

3003
03:36:22,400 --> 03:36:28,240
And the way we do this, now, if you're using a paid account, you would use something like

3004
03:36:28,240 --> 03:36:29,120
organizations.

3005
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:31,360
That's more for a paid account.

3006
03:36:31,360 --> 03:36:39,680
But if you are doing like a free tier, you can set up the roles via using the user metadata.

3007
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:46,240
So now the user metadata is a way for us to save information about the user onto clerk.

3008
03:36:46,240 --> 03:36:52,160
So this is a way to keep information relevant to that user on clerk itself, not in our own

3009
03:36:52,160 --> 03:36:52,960
database.

3010
03:36:52,960 --> 03:36:59,360
We could provide information on our users and create it separately on our own database.

3011
03:36:59,360 --> 03:37:01,360
But that makes it a little more complicated.

3012
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:07,120
So it's best to put that user metadata on the user clerk information as well.

3013
03:37:07,120 --> 03:37:10,720
So if I go back, I just want to show you one last thing.

3014
03:37:10,720 --> 03:37:14,080
Go back to our ERD diagram over here.

3015
03:37:15,040 --> 03:37:16,880
You can see we have our clerk user.

3016
03:37:16,880 --> 03:37:21,200
They have a user ID and a lot of other information.

3017
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:23,600
The clerk is going to save information.

3018
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:28,640
But here we're going to set up in our clerk user in the public metadata.

3019
03:37:28,640 --> 03:37:31,600
We're saving settings information.

3020
03:37:31,600 --> 03:37:38,160
So that will include information about the specific users and then also the user type

3021
03:37:38,160 --> 03:37:39,120
as well.

3022
03:37:39,120 --> 03:37:41,680
So we're all keeping it in the public metadata.

3023
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:47,520
You can keep information about private metadata if you want to keep their stripe key on clerk

3024
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:47,840
user.

3025
03:37:47,840 --> 03:37:49,360
We don't need to do that.

3026
03:37:49,360 --> 03:37:54,960
But if you wanted to do something like that to keep it extra secret, you can use the private

3027
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:56,240
metadata to do so.

3028
03:37:56,240 --> 03:38:03,520
Unsafe metadata is metadata that you can change on both the front end, back end, whereas public

3029
03:38:03,520 --> 03:38:08,080
metadata, you can only change it from the back end, whereas private metadata is even

3030
03:38:08,080 --> 03:38:08,720
more secure.

3031
03:38:10,480 --> 03:38:15,600
So anyways, with that long spiel out of the way, we can go to our user metadata.

3032
03:38:15,600 --> 03:38:18,160
We can actually edit this directly.

3033
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:22,880
And what we want to set is going to be user type like this.

3034
03:38:22,880 --> 03:38:27,360
And we can change this to student or teacher.

3035
03:38:27,360 --> 03:38:31,520
But for now, we're going to have this person as a student.

3036
03:38:31,520 --> 03:38:36,400
So now we can double check if this is working.

3037
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:37,600
So let's go over here.

3038
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:40,800
We can copy this.

3039
03:38:40,800 --> 03:38:47,760
Let's actually console log this right here and go to our application.

3040
03:38:47,760 --> 03:38:52,160
And you can see I'm going to refresh it.

3041
03:38:52,160 --> 03:38:57,440
The user type was now student.

3042
03:38:57,440 --> 03:38:59,200
Before it would be undefined.

3043
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:00,160
Before we put this.

3044
03:39:00,160 --> 03:39:03,040
Now it is registering as student.

3045
03:39:03,040 --> 03:39:08,240
So let's actually change this to teacher just to show you one more time how this works.

3046
03:39:08,240 --> 03:39:09,440
You save it.

3047
03:39:09,440 --> 03:39:10,880
You can refresh it.

3048
03:39:10,880 --> 03:39:12,960
Now you should be able to see that it's a teacher now.

3049
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:23,600
So I mean, this is kind of a easier way to set a specific type of user for now without

3050
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:25,360
creating like a separate admin page.

3051
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:28,640
Clerk makes it pretty easy to do.

3052
03:39:28,640 --> 03:39:29,680
All right.

3053
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:34,480
So from here, we're going to go into author or user pages.

3054
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:38,080
You can see that we have the profile account.

3055
03:39:38,080 --> 03:39:40,320
So this is actually a clerk component.

3056
03:39:40,320 --> 03:39:44,160
And we're just going to slap this in into our profile page.

3057
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:51,280
So we're going to use that for the user profile page and the teacher profile page.

3058
03:39:51,280 --> 03:39:53,040
So this will be super easy.

3059
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:55,200
So we're going to close this up right here.

3060
03:39:55,200 --> 03:39:58,240
So we're going to go up here.

3061
03:39:58,240 --> 03:40:00,720
We're going to have two different types of folders.

3062
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:08,000
Right now we see non dashboard, but we're also going to have another folder called dashboard.

3063
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:13,280
So this includes all the pages that's going to be behind authentication.

3064
03:40:13,280 --> 03:40:20,880
And that includes all of these user pages and teacher pages that we have seen before.

3065
03:40:20,880 --> 03:40:25,920
So the user and teacher page both have this profile component.

3066
03:40:25,920 --> 03:40:30,960
So we are going to create a new folder.

3067
03:40:30,960 --> 03:40:36,000
We're going to call this user and also teacher as well.

3068
03:40:37,920 --> 03:40:41,040
And for each of these, we're going to create a new folder as well.

3069
03:40:41,040 --> 03:40:42,800
We're going to call this profile.

3070
03:40:42,800 --> 03:40:50,080
And we're also going to create another folder for the catch all dot dot dot dot profile.

3071
03:40:50,080 --> 03:40:55,840
We need to do this anytime we are using clerk components.

3072
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:58,160
And we're going to use a new file.

3073
03:40:58,160 --> 03:41:00,240
We're going to do page dot TSX.

3074
03:41:00,240 --> 03:41:04,720
So inside here, I'm going to do RAFCE.

3075
03:41:04,720 --> 03:41:07,200
I'm going to call this user profile page.

3076
03:41:07,200 --> 03:41:15,680
And I'm going to do an empty string or empty, empty fragment, just like that.

3077
03:41:15,680 --> 03:41:20,160
And what we're going to do is we're going to create a header component real quick.

3078
03:41:20,160 --> 03:41:25,680
So that is going to be this particular text right here.

3079
03:41:25,680 --> 03:41:29,040
And because we're going to be using this in multiple places,

3080
03:41:29,040 --> 03:41:31,280
we're going to put it in the components folder.

3081
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:35,440
We're going to call this header dot TSX.

3082
03:41:35,440 --> 03:41:38,400
We're going to do RAFCE.

3083
03:41:38,400 --> 03:41:47,120
Inside here, we're going to pass in title, subtitle, and right element optional.

3084
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:50,800
So this won't play into a role for this particular component.

3085
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:53,360
But later on, we're going to be using it.

3086
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:57,120
We're going to give a div with the class name.

3087
03:41:58,560 --> 03:42:05,920
Inside here, I'm going to do a div with h1 class name of header underscore title.

3088
03:42:05,920 --> 03:42:13,600
With string pass in title as the variable with a p tag.

3089
03:42:13,600 --> 03:42:18,160
It's going to be class name of header underscore subtitle.

3090
03:42:18,160 --> 03:42:21,760
And pass in subtitle over here.

3091
03:42:21,760 --> 03:42:25,920
And then from here, we're going to do right element.

3092
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:28,160
If that exists, we're going to pass in a div.

3093
03:42:28,160 --> 03:42:31,760
We're going to give this a right element like so.

3094
03:42:31,760 --> 03:42:33,600
Close out the div.

3095
03:42:33,600 --> 03:42:36,720
And we should be basically good to go.

3096
03:42:36,720 --> 03:42:42,320
So we can now go to our page component.

3097
03:42:42,320 --> 03:42:46,720
We can pass in header from the components.

3098
03:42:46,720 --> 03:42:51,760
And we can do title is equal to profile.

3099
03:42:53,760 --> 03:43:01,040
With subtitle, view your profile like this.

3100
03:43:01,040 --> 03:43:01,840
Close this out.

3101
03:43:01,840 --> 03:43:09,600
And then finally, we can pass in user profile from @clerk next JS.

3102
03:43:09,600 --> 03:43:11,680
We're going to save it like this.

3103
03:43:11,680 --> 03:43:16,080
So now let's actually just see what it looks like.

3104
03:43:16,800 --> 03:43:23,520
And the way we are going to look at this is we're going to write since we are users,

3105
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:25,920
we're going to do user slash profile.

3106
03:43:25,920 --> 03:43:31,760
And because we're locked in, logged in, we should be able to see this.

3107
03:43:31,760 --> 03:43:34,240
So this is fully interactive.

3108
03:43:34,240 --> 03:43:36,800
And this is kind of the nice thing about @clerk.

3109
03:43:36,800 --> 03:43:45,200
Because you are able to see this, you are able to basically configure everything you need.

3110
03:43:45,840 --> 03:43:46,880
And this is super nice.

3111
03:43:46,880 --> 03:43:51,520
Setting this up and creating this yourself is basically a huge pain.

3112
03:43:51,520 --> 03:43:56,480
So just FYI, having something like this makes life a lot easier.

3113
03:43:56,480 --> 03:44:04,960
But anyways, we can go over here and we are going to set the path to be slash user slash profile.

3114
03:44:04,960 --> 03:44:08,720
And the routing is going to be path.

3115
03:44:08,720 --> 03:44:13,760
So that we are configuring this correctly for the values.

3116
03:44:13,760 --> 03:44:18,960
And then the appearance, we're going to do a base theme and it's going to be dark again.

3117
03:44:18,960 --> 03:44:21,280
Pass that in.

3118
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:33,360
Give it elements with scrollbox colon bg custom grays with dark gray with navbar.

3119
03:44:33,360 --> 03:44:41,920
And give it a string with int div colon nth child one.

3120
03:44:42,880 --> 03:44:44,000
Like so.

3121
03:44:44,000 --> 03:44:47,200
Give it a background of none.

3122
03:44:47,200 --> 03:44:53,920
If we save that, we should see it's going to be in a darker mode.

3123
03:44:53,920 --> 03:44:55,680
More consistent with the styling.

3124
03:44:55,680 --> 03:44:58,240
Now we can go further and make it a little better.

3125
03:44:58,240 --> 03:45:00,400
But for now, this should be good.

3126
03:45:00,400 --> 03:45:03,360
So this is pretty good.

3127
03:45:03,360 --> 03:45:06,480
We're going to do the same thing for teacher.

3128
03:45:06,480 --> 03:45:11,520
So we're going to grab this profile component or profile folder.

3129
03:45:11,520 --> 03:45:14,080
Paste it all of that into the teacher.

3130
03:45:14,080 --> 03:45:19,600
We're going to go over here and just change one little thing.

3131
03:45:19,600 --> 03:45:20,740
Teacher.

3132
03:45:20,740 --> 03:45:24,400
And we should be good to go.

3133
03:45:24,400 --> 03:45:28,640
And we're not going to test this because this currently is a user account.

3134
03:45:28,640 --> 03:45:30,320
We can check things later.

3135
03:45:30,320 --> 03:45:35,440
So that's how easy it is to create a profile account and be able to change.

3136
03:45:35,440 --> 03:45:38,080
Add all the functionality for all of this.

3137
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:44,960
And by the way, if we go back over here, we've already set it up that if you go to manage account,

3138
03:45:44,960 --> 03:45:47,520
it will take you to that specific page.

3139
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:51,840
So all that configuration we did earlier will take you to the correct page.

3140
03:45:51,840 --> 03:45:53,440
All right.

3141
03:45:53,440 --> 03:45:57,520
So now if we go to the manage account, we have this profile page.

3142
03:45:57,520 --> 03:46:03,040
But we do not have what we need over here, which is going to be all of this sidebar.

3143
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:08,400
Now, fortunately for us, and unfortunately for myself,

3144
03:46:10,160 --> 03:46:14,080
we got this new app sidebar from ShadCN.

3145
03:46:14,080 --> 03:46:17,760
So if you go over here, you can see ShadCN.

3146
03:46:17,760 --> 03:46:21,920
This is a new component that ShadCN provides.

3147
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:25,040
And we're going to be using this, providing a lot of functionality.

3148
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:27,920
It was unfortunate for me because they released this

3149
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:31,920
after I've already built the sidebar component.

3150
03:46:31,920 --> 03:46:38,160
So instead, I refactored it, made it so we are using that sidebar component.

3151
03:46:38,560 --> 03:46:41,200
For this specific use case.

3152
03:46:41,200 --> 03:46:50,800
So to do this, I'm going to close all these pages out, open up our dashboard.

3153
03:46:50,800 --> 03:46:55,520
And now all we have to do is create a file called layout.tsx,

3154
03:46:55,520 --> 03:46:59,920
which will apply to all of the pages in our dashboard group.

3155
03:46:59,920 --> 03:47:04,000
So this layout is going to be applied to every single one.

3156
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:08,000
And that would make sense because it's across all these pages that we see.

3157
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:12,640
All right. So we're seeing this error because we have nothing in our layout page.

3158
03:47:12,640 --> 03:47:17,360
Oh, by the way, if you go to the teacher profile, this should not be user profile page.

3159
03:47:17,360 --> 03:47:20,800
This should be teacher profile page.

3160
03:47:20,800 --> 03:47:22,160
Make sure you change both of those.

3161
03:47:22,160 --> 03:47:23,680
We're going to save that.

3162
03:47:23,680 --> 03:47:28,480
And we are now going to add the app sidebar to our layout component.

3163
03:47:28,480 --> 03:47:32,400
So what we're first going to do is go to our layout over here,

3164
03:47:32,960 --> 03:47:38,080
copy everything just so we have some template that we can modify.

3165
03:47:38,080 --> 03:47:40,560
So I'm going to scroll this up so we have more space.

3166
03:47:40,560 --> 03:47:43,280
And we're going to do a couple of things.

3167
03:47:43,280 --> 03:47:50,240
We're going to import navbar from at slash components slash navbar.

3168
03:47:50,240 --> 03:47:52,320
So we have not created that just yet.

3169
03:47:52,320 --> 03:47:55,040
And we're just going to remove all of this.

3170
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:58,240
Like so.

3171
03:47:58,240 --> 03:48:00,320
And we're going to make some modifications.

3172
03:48:00,320 --> 03:48:04,880
So over here, we're going to call this dashboard layout instead.

3173
03:48:04,880 --> 03:48:11,680
And inside, like right above the return, we're going to grab the path name

3174
03:48:11,680 --> 03:48:16,800
and we're going to grab use path name from next navigation.

3175
03:48:16,800 --> 03:48:22,720
So this will be important because the app sidebar will look different on certain pages.

3176
03:48:25,360 --> 03:48:31,920
And that is specifically, namely, this particular page that we see here.

3177
03:48:31,920 --> 03:48:35,280
This is where we see the videos.

3178
03:48:35,280 --> 03:48:40,800
And in the videos, we have this extra sidebar that we are going to create.

3179
03:48:40,800 --> 03:48:47,360
So when this happens, we are going to create this component specifically for this URL,

3180
03:48:47,360 --> 03:48:50,800
but also close our app sidebar when we are on this page.

3181
03:48:50,800 --> 03:48:53,360
So this page will be special.

3182
03:48:53,360 --> 03:48:56,240
We'll be handling that later when we get closer to it.

3183
03:48:56,240 --> 03:48:59,760
But we're just going to set up some of the layouts over here.

3184
03:48:59,760 --> 03:49:05,520
So we're going to do course ID, set course ID over here.

3185
03:49:05,520 --> 03:49:08,160
We're going to grab that from use date.

3186
03:49:08,160 --> 03:49:13,280
Put in string with null like so.

3187
03:49:13,280 --> 03:49:15,280
Pass in null over here.

3188
03:49:15,280 --> 03:49:21,840
And then we're also going to grab our user because now we have the user information

3189
03:49:22,560 --> 03:49:26,560
from clerk and we can easily grab it with use user.

3190
03:49:26,560 --> 03:49:37,440
And I'm just going to create a comment saying handle use effect is course page.

3191
03:49:37,440 --> 03:49:41,040
Now we'll take care of it later because it will make more sense later if we do that.

3192
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:48,800
But for now, if the page is not loaded, we can do return and we're going to use our loading

3193
03:49:48,800 --> 03:49:49,300
component.

3194
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:52,880
So that makes it super easy because we've created all of that.

3195
03:49:52,880 --> 03:49:59,200
And if user is not signed in, we can do return with div.

3196
03:49:59,200 --> 03:50:04,480
Please sign in to access this page.

3197
03:50:04,480 --> 03:50:07,120
So a couple of things.

3198
03:50:07,120 --> 03:50:10,960
We're going to change the non-dashboard layout because this is now dashboard.

3199
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:18,320
This should be dashboard body underscore body like so.

3200
03:50:19,520 --> 03:50:21,680
And we're going to add a few things.

3201
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:32,960
So our sidebar will go here, but our div is going to be including a class name with dashboard

3202
03:50:32,960 --> 03:50:34,320
underscore content.

3203
03:50:34,320 --> 03:50:38,160
And I'll explain how this layout will work.

3204
03:50:38,160 --> 03:50:41,760
So this should all enclose that.

3205
03:50:43,840 --> 03:50:52,160
And over here is going to be where the chapters sidebar will go if it is the course page,

3206
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:54,320
which we'll handle later.

3207
03:50:54,320 --> 03:50:58,400
And finally, we're going to have a div with class name.

3208
03:50:58,400 --> 03:51:05,920
And this is the first time we're going to be using CN, which is a utils from Tailwind

3209
03:51:05,920 --> 03:51:08,160
to make it a little bit nicer.

3210
03:51:08,960 --> 03:51:17,600
We're going to pass in dashboard double underscore main like so.

3211
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:19,200
We're going to keep it like this for now.

3212
03:51:19,200 --> 03:51:26,640
And we're also going to set the style to be a height of 100 viewport height.

3213
03:51:26,640 --> 03:51:32,560
So this will give us full height for the actual main section.

3214
03:51:34,080 --> 03:51:39,600
Now, again, we have an error because we need to do use client for the specific page.

3215
03:51:39,600 --> 03:51:45,840
And finally, what we need for the sidebar is we're going to provide a sidebar provider.

3216
03:51:45,840 --> 03:51:51,680
So this comes from the sidebar component, and we need to wrap our sidebar component

3217
03:51:51,680 --> 03:51:58,080
with this sidebar provider so that it is able to access the state and we can access the state

3218
03:51:58,080 --> 03:52:00,240
as we want.

3219
03:52:00,240 --> 03:52:07,360
And inside our dashboard component, this is where our app sidebar will exist.

3220
03:52:07,360 --> 03:52:12,560
So this is this right here.

3221
03:52:12,560 --> 03:52:17,680
Dashboard is going to flex both this item and the rest of the content.

3222
03:52:17,680 --> 03:52:23,120
So that means if you were to look on this layout, the sidebar would exist right here.

3223
03:52:23,120 --> 03:52:27,360
And then the content will be the rest of this page.

3224
03:52:27,360 --> 03:52:30,080
That's how this will basically work.

3225
03:52:31,360 --> 03:52:37,840
And if the sidebar does exist for the chapter sidebar, that will go over here as well.

3226
03:52:37,840 --> 03:52:43,120
So this is all kind of flexed apart to make sure everything is aligned correctly.

3227
03:52:43,120 --> 03:52:46,320
It'll make more sense as we go along.

3228
03:52:46,320 --> 03:52:49,040
So let's actually create our app sidebar.

3229
03:52:49,040 --> 03:52:55,120
So let's go down into our components, create a new file, and we're going to call this

3230
03:52:55,120 --> 03:52:58,240
app sidebar dot TSX.

3231
03:52:58,800 --> 03:53:02,960
Inside here, I'm going to call this RAFCE.

3232
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:06,960
And we are going to import a few things.

3233
03:53:06,960 --> 03:53:10,640
Now, if you notice on the app sidebar.

3234
03:53:10,640 --> 03:53:17,120
Right here, scroll over here, you can see we have a sign out button,

3235
03:53:17,120 --> 03:53:20,720
so we can do that exactly the way we've been doing it.

3236
03:53:20,720 --> 03:53:22,720
This one is a little bit different.

3237
03:53:22,720 --> 03:53:26,480
So first, we want to make sure the user is signed in.

3238
03:53:26,480 --> 03:53:28,320
So we're going to have use user.

3239
03:53:28,320 --> 03:53:30,480
We're also going to grab sign out.

3240
03:53:30,480 --> 03:53:34,880
So this is just a hook function that we can grab from use clerk.

3241
03:53:34,880 --> 03:53:39,840
So this if we have a button, we can make sure the user clicks this button.

3242
03:53:39,840 --> 03:53:44,880
And if this is this function is triggered, then the user is signed out automatically.

3243
03:53:44,880 --> 03:53:48,800
And then from here, we're going to grab the path name,

3244
03:53:48,800 --> 03:53:52,960
grab the path name from navigation.

3245
03:53:52,960 --> 03:53:55,360
We can do toggle sidebar.

3246
03:53:56,400 --> 03:54:00,000
We're going to use sidebar like so grab it.

3247
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:04,880
Now, use user is hasn't been imported.

3248
03:54:04,880 --> 03:54:14,400
And personally, when I import ShadCN components, I personally like having the at alias.

3249
03:54:14,400 --> 03:54:18,800
By the way, I haven't covered it, but the at alias allows us from Next.js

3250
03:54:18,800 --> 03:54:25,440
to start and grab imports directly starting from this source directory.

3251
03:54:25,440 --> 03:54:30,160
So at components, UI sidebar.

3252
03:54:30,160 --> 03:54:32,560
So that's how we can grab it.

3253
03:54:32,560 --> 03:54:41,040
And then from here, we're going to be creating all the nav links that we need for the entire

3254
03:54:41,040 --> 03:54:45,920
sidebar, and we're going to have two different sets.

3255
03:54:45,920 --> 03:54:52,400
So inside here, we're going to have student colon within the array,

3256
03:54:52,400 --> 03:54:56,240
and we're going to pass in icon with a book open.

3257
03:54:56,240 --> 03:55:04,720
So from Lucite React, we're going to have a label of courses and an href

3258
03:55:04,720 --> 03:55:11,920
colon of user or slash user slash courses like so.

3259
03:55:11,920 --> 03:55:20,080
And what I want to do is just copy this four times because we have four links on our sidebar.

3260
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:22,880
This one is going to be a briefcase.

3261
03:55:22,880 --> 03:55:25,040
Make sure you import that.

3262
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:28,080
And this one is going to be billing.

3263
03:55:28,080 --> 03:55:33,440
So we're going to have user slash billing like so.

3264
03:55:33,440 --> 03:55:38,560
And then the next icon is going to be user from Lucite React.

3265
03:55:38,560 --> 03:55:41,760
This is going to be a profile label.

3266
03:55:41,760 --> 03:55:47,200
And this is going to be user slash profile.

3267
03:55:49,200 --> 03:55:51,600
And then finally, we're going to have settings.

3268
03:55:51,600 --> 03:56:00,640
But the label of settings and then the href is going to be user slash settings.

3269
03:56:00,640 --> 03:56:09,760
And then we're going to copy this entire thing, but put teacher for the next one and paste it

3270
03:56:09,760 --> 03:56:10,240
over here.

3271
03:56:10,240 --> 03:56:14,160
Most of this is going to be the same.

3272
03:56:14,960 --> 03:56:22,800
We're going to change this to money, let's say, or dollar sign.

3273
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:24,160
I don't know.

3274
03:56:24,160 --> 03:56:24,960
Doesn't really matter.

3275
03:56:24,960 --> 03:56:28,960
But every single one where you see slash user.

3276
03:56:28,960 --> 03:56:35,200
So I'm going to do command D for all of them and pass in teacher like this.

3277
03:56:35,200 --> 03:56:40,480
By the way, these should not be capitalized.

3278
03:56:40,480 --> 03:56:41,600
So we have settings.

3279
03:56:41,600 --> 03:56:43,280
So this will set up our nav links.

3280
03:56:44,240 --> 03:56:52,240
And then from here, we're going to do if statement just to make sure we have this loaded check.

3281
03:56:52,240 --> 03:56:54,720
We're going to return loading.

3282
03:56:54,720 --> 03:57:02,880
Right here from our loading components makes it super easy.

3283
03:57:02,880 --> 03:57:12,080
If and the user is not found, we're just going to return div user not found.

3284
03:57:13,840 --> 03:57:19,760
And then from here, we're going to grab the user type because the user type is what matters.

3285
03:57:19,760 --> 03:57:23,600
So the nav links is dependent on the user type that we have.

3286
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:28,400
So we're going to grab user public metadata dot user type.

3287
03:57:28,400 --> 03:57:32,400
And we're going to set that as student.

3288
03:57:32,400 --> 03:57:38,080
This is for TypeScript typing or teacher.

3289
03:57:38,080 --> 03:57:44,320
Or if none of those exist, we're going to default to student.

3290
03:57:44,320 --> 03:57:51,760
And we're going to set const current nav links to be nav links of user type.

3291
03:57:51,760 --> 03:57:58,640
So depending on the user role, we're going to set that to the correct list of nav links.

3292
03:57:58,640 --> 03:58:01,920
All right.

3293
03:58:01,920 --> 03:58:10,880
So over here, we're going to pass in sidebar from at component slash UI sidebar.

3294
03:58:10,880 --> 03:58:18,400
We need to make this collapsible and set this to icon.

3295
03:58:18,400 --> 03:58:22,960
That allows us to collapse it to the icon size of the sidebar.

3296
03:58:22,960 --> 03:58:29,920
And we're also going to give it a style of height collapsible.

3297
03:58:29,920 --> 03:58:35,280
Height colon 100 viewport height.

3298
03:58:35,280 --> 03:58:39,840
Sometimes you have to use these inline styling instead of tailing classes

3299
03:58:39,840 --> 03:58:43,920
because it is not specific enough and sometimes it does not work.

3300
03:58:43,920 --> 03:58:53,760
And we're going to set this to be background custom grays, promy, BG, border of none.

3301
03:58:53,760 --> 03:58:55,760
Shadow is going to be large.

3302
03:58:58,480 --> 03:59:01,680
So inside our sidebar, we're going to have a sidebar header.

3303
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:09,840
Make sure we pass that in for the right import with sidebar menu.

3304
03:59:09,840 --> 03:59:17,600
With class name of app dash sidebar underscore menu.

3305
03:59:17,600 --> 03:59:20,000
Close that in.

3306
03:59:20,000 --> 03:59:23,840
Give it sidebar menu item.

3307
03:59:23,840 --> 03:59:25,120
Close that.

3308
03:59:26,640 --> 03:59:28,960
Make sure we import those though.

3309
03:59:28,960 --> 03:59:36,800
And then finally, we're going to have sidebar menu button.

3310
03:59:36,800 --> 03:59:38,560
Make sure you import that.

3311
03:59:38,560 --> 03:59:48,640
Inside here, we're going to do size is going to be large.

3312
03:59:48,640 --> 03:59:51,280
By the way, there's a lot of documentation for this.

3313
03:59:51,280 --> 03:59:52,560
So you can take a look.

3314
03:59:52,560 --> 03:59:54,880
There is a lot of different options.

3315
03:59:56,000 --> 04:00:02,000
Little rough around the edges, but they just released it couple one week ago

3316
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:06,800
from the release of this video or maybe like two weeks ago.

3317
04:00:06,800 --> 04:00:11,920
So just realize it's very new, but it's quite nice.

3318
04:00:11,920 --> 04:00:16,480
Sidebars are kind of a pain.

3319
04:00:16,480 --> 04:00:18,720
I'll tell you sidebars are very pain.

3320
04:00:18,720 --> 04:00:20,000
You don't want to deal with it.

3321
04:00:23,360 --> 04:00:26,880
And then we're going to grab the toggle sidebar that we created or that we

3322
04:00:26,880 --> 04:00:28,160
got from you sidebar.

3323
04:00:28,160 --> 04:00:35,200
So this allows us to close and open the sidebar and collapse it if we need to.

3324
04:00:35,200 --> 04:00:37,440
And make sure we invoke it like this.

3325
04:00:37,440 --> 04:00:44,400
So we're going to have a class name is equal to group with hover BG custom

3326
04:00:44,400 --> 04:00:48,240
graze secondary background like so.

3327
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:55,360
And by the way, we are currently building out this top line.

3328
04:00:55,360 --> 04:00:58,080
So if we click on it, it's going to help us close it.

3329
04:00:58,080 --> 04:01:05,040
So over here, we're going to have a div with class name app slash sidebar

3330
04:01:05,040 --> 04:01:10,800
underscore logo dash container group like so.

3331
04:01:10,800 --> 04:01:15,200
I'm just going to grab all of this.

3332
04:01:15,200 --> 04:01:17,760
Like so.

3333
04:01:17,760 --> 04:01:20,320
So we don't have to write that every single time.

3334
04:01:21,440 --> 04:01:24,960
I'm going to do div paste that logo wrapper.

3335
04:01:24,960 --> 04:01:28,720
Close that out.

3336
04:01:28,720 --> 04:01:32,640
Bring in the image component from next.

3337
04:01:32,640 --> 04:01:43,520
And we're going to do source is equal to slash logo dot SVG.

3338
04:01:43,520 --> 04:01:48,880
And by the way, I have not actually imported this.

3339
04:01:48,880 --> 04:01:52,480
If you go to asset downloads, you should have a logo SVG.

3340
04:01:52,480 --> 04:01:54,720
I just forgot to add it while I was recording it.

3341
04:01:54,720 --> 04:01:55,840
So I added it.

3342
04:01:55,840 --> 04:01:56,960
You should be able to see this.

3343
04:01:56,960 --> 04:02:02,160
You should copy this, go to public and paste it over here.

3344
04:02:02,160 --> 04:02:03,440
So you should have that logo.

3345
04:02:03,440 --> 04:02:06,640
So I'm going to close that over here.

3346
04:02:06,640 --> 04:02:10,480
Go back to writing our code.

3347
04:02:10,480 --> 04:02:15,680
So over here, I'm going to do alt is equal to logo.

3348
04:02:17,760 --> 04:02:20,080
And width is going to be 25.

3349
04:02:20,080 --> 04:02:22,560
Height is going to be 20.

3350
04:02:22,560 --> 04:02:31,840
The class name of app dash sidebar underscore logo.

3351
04:02:31,840 --> 04:02:34,960
And we're going to do a p tag with.

3352
04:02:34,960 --> 04:02:43,200
Class name app sidebar underscore title colon ed row.

3353
04:02:46,400 --> 04:02:51,200
And over here, we're going to do a panel left, which is an icon from Lucid React.

3354
04:02:51,200 --> 04:03:02,080
Give it a class name with app dash side sidebar underscore collapse dash icon like so.

3355
04:03:02,080 --> 04:03:03,600
And we can save it.

3356
04:03:03,600 --> 04:03:07,920
It's very nice.

3357
04:03:07,920 --> 04:03:09,840
Just a lot of components right here.

3358
04:03:09,840 --> 04:03:15,760
There's just a lot of JSX elements below this sidebar header.

3359
04:03:15,760 --> 04:03:18,400
We are going to create the sidebar content.

3360
04:03:18,400 --> 04:03:20,960
We're going to import that from sidebar.

3361
04:03:20,960 --> 04:03:27,200
And then inside here, we're going to pass inside bar menu, which we've already imported.

3362
04:03:27,200 --> 04:03:32,880
Give it a class name of app sidebar underscore nav dash menu.

3363
04:03:32,880 --> 04:03:34,400
Close that.

3364
04:03:34,400 --> 04:03:40,320
And from here, we can now pass in the current nav links.

3365
04:03:40,320 --> 04:03:41,920
So these were the headers.

3366
04:03:41,920 --> 04:03:43,360
Now we're dealing with the content.

3367
04:03:43,360 --> 04:03:48,000
So that's going to display out these elements.

3368
04:03:48,000 --> 04:03:53,200
So current nav links, we're going to map this out, pass in the link.

3369
04:03:53,200 --> 04:04:02,320
And put an arrow function, make sure we close this like so.

3370
04:04:05,200 --> 04:04:16,240
We're going to have const is active is equal to path name dot starts with and link dot href like so.

3371
04:04:16,240 --> 04:04:19,840
So we're going to determine if it's active.

3372
04:04:19,840 --> 04:04:22,400
And if it's active, we're going to give it a different background color.

3373
04:04:22,400 --> 04:04:27,200
So sidebar menu item.

3374
04:04:30,400 --> 04:04:36,080
And in here, we're going to pass in a kink or a key link dot href.

3375
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:44,320
And we're going to do class name is equal to what CN pass this in app dash sidebar

3376
04:04:44,320 --> 04:04:48,880
underscore nav dash item.

3377
04:04:48,880 --> 04:04:50,960
However, we're also going to have a conditional.

3378
04:04:50,960 --> 04:04:52,240
We're going to do is active.

3379
04:04:53,520 --> 04:05:00,640
And when it's active, we want to add a class of background gray 800.

3380
04:05:00,640 --> 04:05:06,080
And make sure we import CN from libutils.

3381
04:05:06,080 --> 04:05:11,840
We're going to close the sidebar menu item up and inside here.

3382
04:05:11,840 --> 04:05:16,560
We're going to add a sidebar menu button.

3383
04:05:16,560 --> 04:05:19,200
Close this.

3384
04:05:21,680 --> 04:05:24,880
Inside here, we're going to set this as a child.

3385
04:05:24,880 --> 04:05:28,240
Give it a size of large.

3386
04:05:28,240 --> 04:05:41,200
Give it a class name of colon CN app sidebar underscore nav dash button.

3387
04:05:41,200 --> 04:05:50,320
And if it's not active, we are also going to give this a text of custom grays.

3388
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:52,640
Dirty gray.

3389
04:05:52,640 --> 04:05:54,800
Like so.

3390
04:05:54,800 --> 04:06:04,800
And finally, inside here, we're going to give it a link with the href link dot href.

3391
04:06:04,800 --> 04:06:12,320
I'm going to paste app sidebar nav dash link colon like this.

3392
04:06:12,320 --> 04:06:18,400
Inside here, I'm going to pass in link dot icon.

3393
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:20,240
Close this out.

3394
04:06:20,240 --> 04:06:27,840
Inside here, pass in class name is equal to is active.

3395
04:06:27,840 --> 04:06:33,760
And if it is active, we're going to give it a text of white 50.

3396
04:06:33,760 --> 04:06:38,960
Otherwise, we're going to give it a text of gray 500.

3397
04:06:38,960 --> 04:06:44,160
I want to make sure we passed in the link tag from next link.

3398
04:06:45,920 --> 04:06:48,480
And we're also going to pass in a span.

3399
04:06:48,480 --> 04:06:56,320
And we're going to give it a class name with CN.

3400
04:06:56,320 --> 04:07:00,800
I know this is a lot of styling and setup, but it is a sidebar.

3401
04:07:00,800 --> 04:07:06,640
So give it a nav text like this is active.

3402
04:07:06,640 --> 04:07:13,920
Question mark text of white dash 50 colon text of gray 500.

3403
04:07:15,360 --> 04:07:22,320
And inside here, we're going to pass in link dot label.

3404
04:07:22,320 --> 04:07:26,640
OK, so we're almost there.

3405
04:07:26,640 --> 04:07:27,680
We're almost there.

3406
04:07:27,680 --> 04:07:30,800
Let's actually see if we can see it.

3407
04:07:30,800 --> 04:07:31,120
Nope.

3408
04:07:31,120 --> 04:07:36,640
We're going to pass app sidebar in.

3409
04:07:36,640 --> 04:07:41,120
OK, and then if we open it, we can see most of it.

3410
04:07:41,120 --> 04:07:43,440
It seems like our text is not displaying.

3411
04:07:44,400 --> 04:07:49,760
Let's go back and we should probably get to fixing some of this.

3412
04:07:49,760 --> 04:07:57,360
So over here, we're going to close this and we're going to say is active.

3413
04:07:57,360 --> 04:08:01,520
And we're going to give it a div class name.

3414
04:08:01,520 --> 04:08:07,680
App sidebar underscore active dash indicator.

3415
04:08:07,680 --> 04:08:11,280
Close that out.

3416
04:08:12,080 --> 04:08:16,800
And we're going to go down right below sidebar content and we are going to pass

3417
04:08:16,800 --> 04:08:20,080
in sidebar further from the components.

3418
04:08:20,080 --> 04:08:23,280
We're going to pass inside bar menu.

3419
04:08:23,280 --> 04:08:26,240
Close that out.

3420
04:08:26,240 --> 04:08:28,880
Sidebar menu item.

3421
04:08:28,880 --> 04:08:31,200
Close that out as well.

3422
04:08:31,200 --> 04:08:34,640
Sidebar menu button.

3423
04:08:34,640 --> 04:08:36,480
We're going to set this as as child.

3424
04:08:37,600 --> 04:08:41,360
Close that and give it a simple button tag.

3425
04:08:41,360 --> 04:08:50,080
Inside here, I'm going to do on click and we're going to finally use that sign out

3426
04:08:50,080 --> 04:08:52,080
function that we talked about earlier.

3427
04:08:52,080 --> 04:08:59,360
Give it a class name of app dash sidebar underscore sign out.

3428
04:08:59,360 --> 04:09:04,560
And we're going to pass in the component log out from Lucidwiki.

3429
04:09:05,760 --> 04:09:07,680
Give it a class name.

3430
04:09:07,680 --> 04:09:13,920
With margin right of 2h6 width of 6.

3431
04:09:13,920 --> 04:09:15,520
Close that.

3432
04:09:15,520 --> 04:09:19,840
Give it a span and we're going to sign out.

3433
04:09:19,840 --> 04:09:24,080
So with this, we do have some issues, as you can see.

3434
04:09:24,080 --> 04:09:29,120
Some of the colors are off and then the text is not even visible.

3435
04:09:29,120 --> 04:09:31,360
So let's try and fix this.

3436
04:09:32,560 --> 04:09:35,600
The reason why is because of this link dot icon.

3437
04:09:35,600 --> 04:09:36,960
Let's remove that.

3438
04:09:36,960 --> 04:09:38,800
This should be self-closing over here.

3439
04:09:38,800 --> 04:09:41,760
And then you should be able to see the text now.

3440
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:46,240
And so with that, it should be pretty good now.

3441
04:09:46,240 --> 04:09:48,720
So now if you can see, you can collapse it.

3442
04:09:48,720 --> 04:09:52,000
You can see all of this working as expected.

3443
04:09:52,000 --> 04:09:57,120
So if you go further, it's going to collapse on its own, which is good.

3444
04:09:57,120 --> 04:09:58,800
This is exactly what we want.

3445
04:09:58,800 --> 04:10:00,960
So now we have a new component.

3446
04:10:00,960 --> 04:10:05,520
So now we have our app sidebar, which is very nice and convenient.

3447
04:10:05,520 --> 04:10:08,640
We do need a nav bar at the top.

3448
04:10:08,640 --> 04:10:15,600
So if you go over here, you can see every page is going to have this top nav bar as well.

3449
04:10:15,600 --> 04:10:20,000
So we need to create that so we can go back to our layout page.

3450
04:10:20,000 --> 04:10:24,400
We're going to create a nav bar component up here, which we have not created.

3451
04:10:24,400 --> 04:10:29,760
So let's go over here, create a component, and we're going to call this navbar dot TSX.

3452
04:10:31,040 --> 04:10:35,840
Now inside here, I'm going to just grab everything we had in non-dashboard navbar,

3453
04:10:35,840 --> 04:10:40,320
copy it, paste it into the navbar component.

3454
04:10:40,320 --> 04:10:47,680
Now we'll just do a lot of modifications from here, but it should give us a good starting point.

3455
04:10:47,680 --> 04:10:56,000
So I'm going to change this non-dashboard navbar, and we are going to pass in is course page.

3456
04:10:56,800 --> 04:11:00,640
And this is the navbar is going to be slightly different,

3457
04:11:00,640 --> 04:11:06,400
depending on if we are on the course page, as we mentioned before.

3458
04:11:06,400 --> 04:11:10,560
Now from here, we're going to add is dark mode.

3459
04:11:10,560 --> 04:11:13,760
We're going to set is dark mode as well.

3460
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:17,040
Pass in use state from react.

3461
04:11:17,040 --> 04:11:22,480
Pass in false for the state as well.

3462
04:11:23,200 --> 04:11:26,400
And for now, we're just going to grab all of these non-dashboards,

3463
04:11:26,400 --> 04:11:30,640
select all of them by pressing command D and just holding it.

3464
04:11:30,640 --> 04:11:38,160
Change this to dashboard dash navbar, and we're going to make some modifications.

3465
04:11:38,160 --> 04:11:44,400
So we don't need this link tag anymore, but instead we're going to give this a div,

3466
04:11:44,400 --> 04:11:50,160
and we're going to do a class name of when it's larger than medium size screen,

3467
04:11:50,160 --> 04:11:52,320
we're going to give it a hidden.

3468
04:11:52,960 --> 04:11:56,480
And what we're going to do is we're going to pass inside bar trigger.

3469
04:11:56,480 --> 04:12:00,560
And that comes from the UI component.

3470
04:12:00,560 --> 04:12:02,560
So this is from the shadcn.

3471
04:12:02,560 --> 04:12:06,480
We want to make sure we grab this.

3472
04:12:06,480 --> 04:12:10,880
This is so that we can collapse the sidebar as we normally did,

3473
04:12:10,880 --> 04:12:14,000
but it's in the navbar itself.

3474
04:12:14,000 --> 04:12:17,760
We're going to pass this class name like this.

3475
04:12:17,760 --> 04:12:20,880
Go over here and save it.

3476
04:12:22,000 --> 04:12:30,000
Over here, we're going to keep a lot of this the same and pass in cn with parens.

3477
04:12:30,000 --> 04:12:36,160
And we're going to add dashboard dash navbar underscore search dash input

3478
04:12:36,160 --> 04:12:40,000
colon or comma with curly braces.

3479
04:12:40,000 --> 04:12:43,680
And we're going to grab, we're going to remove this right here.

3480
04:12:43,680 --> 04:12:46,960
Inside here, we're going to put a string.

3481
04:12:48,640 --> 04:12:55,120
We're going to say bg custom grays secondary background.

3482
04:12:55,120 --> 04:12:59,760
And that is only if it is a course page like this.

3483
04:12:59,760 --> 04:13:03,440
We're going to grab the cn from libutils.

3484
04:13:03,440 --> 04:13:06,800
And we are missing a closing curly braces right here.

3485
04:13:06,800 --> 04:13:09,040
And we're going to keep most of that the same.

3486
04:13:09,040 --> 04:13:12,400
And from here, we can keep the bell icon.

3487
04:13:12,400 --> 04:13:16,000
Actually, I don't know why I put the is dark mode, we can just remove that.

3488
04:13:16,800 --> 04:13:18,880
We're going to keep everything the same.

3489
04:13:18,880 --> 04:13:22,000
And for this part, we actually don't need the sign in signed out

3490
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:23,680
because we've already protected it.

3491
04:13:23,680 --> 04:13:28,960
We can just keep the user button like this, pretty much everything the same.

3492
04:13:28,960 --> 04:13:33,440
And we're going to remove non dashboard, which is going to keep navbar just like this.

3493
04:13:33,440 --> 04:13:38,800
And now we should be able to see what we have over here.

3494
04:13:38,800 --> 04:13:44,000
And for this part right here, you can see that this is a bell icon.

3495
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:45,440
That's because these are not styled.

3496
04:13:45,440 --> 04:13:50,160
We're just going to default to using non dashboard navbar to make it look nice.

3497
04:13:50,160 --> 04:13:55,200
And you can see, we have everything set up.

3498
04:13:55,200 --> 04:14:00,720
So if I go over here, close this out, we can see we have this icon.

3499
04:14:00,720 --> 04:14:04,720
So this is how it looks like when we are on this.

3500
04:14:04,720 --> 04:14:07,120
The only thing is we do get these errors.

3501
04:14:07,120 --> 04:14:09,680
Dialogue content requires a dialogue title.

3502
04:14:09,680 --> 04:14:13,120
I'm not exactly sure how to solve that one because

3503
04:14:13,120 --> 04:14:17,440
app sidebar has abstracted out a little bit of the dialogue content.

3504
04:14:17,440 --> 04:14:27,680
I guess if you can go to sidebar dialogue, we can write sheet title over here,

3505
04:14:27,680 --> 04:14:34,320
place it in, we can say menu sidebar, something like that.

3506
04:14:34,320 --> 04:14:41,760
And maybe if you refresh it, we're going to open this up and we don't have an error.

3507
04:14:41,760 --> 04:14:44,160
But we do have this problem over here.

3508
04:14:44,160 --> 04:14:51,120
So we want to pass in visually and we're just going to pass in class name of hidden.

3509
04:14:51,120 --> 04:14:55,200
So that will basically get our error out.

3510
04:14:55,200 --> 04:14:57,600
So this will fix the error that we had.

3511
04:14:57,600 --> 04:15:01,440
So I refresh the page, open this up.

3512
04:15:01,440 --> 04:15:04,240
We no longer have an issue with that.

3513
04:15:04,240 --> 04:15:04,640
All right.

3514
04:15:04,640 --> 04:15:08,320
So the next page we're going to be looking at is over here.

3515
04:15:08,320 --> 04:15:12,800
If we go down, we can see the user settings page.

3516
04:15:12,800 --> 04:15:19,600
This user setting page is going to store information in the clerk user data.

3517
04:15:19,600 --> 04:15:26,160
So basically, if I go back to our diagram, you can see that we have clerk user.

3518
04:15:26,160 --> 04:15:29,040
We have settings being saved here.

3519
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:36,240
So we're going to be saving course notifications, email alerts, SMS alerts, and notification frequency.

3520
04:15:36,240 --> 04:15:39,360
We're going to store that information into clerk itself.

3521
04:15:39,360 --> 04:15:45,840
Now, it's not ideal to store information in clerk because there's a limit to how much you can store.

3522
04:15:45,840 --> 04:15:50,320
But it is nice to keep that type of information together.

3523
04:15:50,320 --> 04:15:53,600
So to do that, we need to create an endpoint.

3524
04:15:53,600 --> 04:15:56,960
So let's close all of this out.

3525
04:15:56,960 --> 04:16:00,320
And we're going to start by going back to the back end.

3526
04:16:00,320 --> 04:16:06,080
So I'm going to close out client and go back to our server.

3527
04:16:06,080 --> 04:16:08,160
So we're going to go to our controllers.

3528
04:16:08,160 --> 04:16:09,440
I'm going to create a new file.

3529
04:16:09,440 --> 04:16:14,880
And I'm going to just call this user clerk controller to be more specific.

3530
04:16:14,880 --> 04:16:20,240
And in here, I'm going to go back to course controller.

3531
04:16:20,240 --> 04:16:25,760
I'm going to copy this get course just so we have like a template.

3532
04:16:25,760 --> 04:16:29,600
And I'm going to paste it over here.

3533
04:16:29,600 --> 04:16:33,280
Now, we're obviously missing a few things.

3534
04:16:33,280 --> 04:16:34,560
So I'm going to rewrite this.

3535
04:16:35,280 --> 04:16:36,880
Get request from Express.

3536
04:16:36,880 --> 04:16:41,360
Get response from Express as well.

3537
04:16:41,360 --> 04:16:44,000
And we should have most of what we need.

3538
04:16:44,000 --> 04:16:51,920
Now, for us to save information into our clerk, we need to create a clerk client.

3539
04:16:51,920 --> 04:16:53,920
So we would go to the index file.

3540
04:16:53,920 --> 04:16:57,840
And I would go all the way up to configurations.

3541
04:16:57,840 --> 04:17:02,720
And right here, I would write export const clerk client.

3542
04:17:02,720 --> 04:17:06,160
Because we want to instantiate it in our index file.

3543
04:17:06,160 --> 04:17:11,440
So basically, when the server starts, we're going to use create clerk client,

3544
04:17:11,440 --> 04:17:23,040
which is going to be imported from create clerk client from @clerk/express.

3545
04:17:24,320 --> 04:17:34,480
And we're going to pass in secret key with process.env.clerk_secret_key.

3546
04:17:34,480 --> 04:17:40,720
So this is how we connect to our clerk client from our Express server.

3547
04:17:40,720 --> 04:17:45,120
So the first thing we need to do is grab this @clerk/express,

3548
04:17:45,120 --> 04:17:51,360
close out our server, and write npm i @clerk/express.

3549
04:17:52,240 --> 04:17:58,080
Once we have done that, we can run npm run dev once again, close this out.

3550
04:17:58,080 --> 04:18:06,880
And now we can import in our user controller, we can import clerk client

3551
04:18:06,880 --> 04:18:14,400
from dot dot slash index.

3552
04:18:14,400 --> 04:18:17,760
And then from here, we're going to change this to update user.

3553
04:18:18,880 --> 04:18:27,680
Go over here, we're going to just do const user ID to grab user ID from rec dot params.

3554
04:18:27,680 --> 04:18:32,480
And then grab user data from rec dot body.

3555
04:18:32,480 --> 04:18:39,840
And get rid of all of this because we no longer need it for this one.

3556
04:18:39,840 --> 04:18:47,360
But we need to do a wait clerk client dot users dot update user metadata.

3557
04:18:48,160 --> 04:18:51,920
So this is how we update the metadata in our clerk client.

3558
04:18:51,920 --> 04:19:02,320
And we do need to pass in the user ID and pass in public metadata colon object,

3559
04:19:02,320 --> 04:19:05,360
we pass in user type like I mentioned before.

3560
04:19:05,360 --> 04:19:11,840
So we're going to grab that from public metadata dot user type,

3561
04:19:11,840 --> 04:19:13,440
which we grab from the front end.

3562
04:19:14,160 --> 04:19:21,120
And then also settings, which we also grab from user data dot public metadata dot settings.

3563
04:19:21,120 --> 04:19:29,200
And then from here, we can just write user updated success fully.

3564
04:19:29,200 --> 04:19:33,440
And we don't need to pass data for this one specifically.

3565
04:19:33,440 --> 04:19:39,680
We can change this to error updating user, keep the error as is.

3566
04:19:40,880 --> 04:19:45,040
Now the only thing we have left to do for this is we need to change this

3567
04:19:45,040 --> 04:19:48,800
or we need to add this environment variable for clerk secret key.

3568
04:19:48,800 --> 04:19:55,440
So if you go back to your env dot local on your front end, we can grab all of this,

3569
04:19:55,440 --> 04:20:00,640
go to our dot env, and then paste it over here.

3570
04:20:00,640 --> 04:20:06,960
And then finally, we need to set up a route for this specific controller.

3571
04:20:06,960 --> 04:20:11,040
So user clerk routes dot ts.

3572
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:16,400
And I'm going to go to course routes, just copy all of this, paste it over here.

3573
04:20:16,400 --> 04:20:22,000
And I'm going to replace this with update user.

3574
04:20:22,000 --> 04:20:26,560
And we are going to grab this from user clerk controller.

3575
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:36,800
And then change all of this to rather dot put string slash user ID, like so.

3576
04:20:37,760 --> 04:20:40,080
And then we're going to do update user.

3577
04:20:40,080 --> 04:20:44,960
And then finally, we go to our index file.

3578
04:20:44,960 --> 04:20:49,520
And then I can go to right below the app dot use.

3579
04:20:49,520 --> 04:20:55,920
We can write slash users slash clerk for our particular route.

3580
04:20:55,920 --> 04:20:59,840
And we can set user clerk routes like so.

3581
04:21:01,280 --> 04:21:11,840
And we need to make sure we import that from dot slash routes slash user clerk routes.

3582
04:21:11,840 --> 04:21:19,200
All right, so here, I'm going to close all of these out right here.

3583
04:21:19,200 --> 04:21:26,000
And now we can finally go back to our front end, we can go to source state API.

3584
04:21:27,280 --> 04:21:32,160
Inside here, I'm going to scroll down, go to our endpoints.

3585
04:21:32,160 --> 04:21:38,880
And right above here, we can have a separate endpoint, and we can call this update user.

3586
04:21:38,880 --> 04:21:45,920
Now this time, this is not build query, it's going to be build mutation,

3587
04:21:45,920 --> 04:21:47,760
because we're updating instead.

3588
04:21:47,760 --> 04:21:55,280
So when you are using like a put method or anything that involves delete, post,

3589
04:21:55,280 --> 04:21:59,200
anything that changes data in the back end that's already existing,

3590
04:21:59,200 --> 04:22:03,280
or creating a new one, then you use build dot mutation.

3591
04:22:03,280 --> 04:22:07,520
So what it's going to return is going to be the user object,

3592
04:22:07,520 --> 04:22:13,040
whereas we are going to pass in partial user information to the back end.

3593
04:22:13,040 --> 04:22:20,160
And we are going to also send user ID colon as a string for the types.

3594
04:22:21,280 --> 04:22:28,560
And in this object, we are going to set query, and we are going to pass in both user ID

3595
04:22:28,560 --> 04:22:41,120
dot dot dot updated user with an arrow function and putting in URL with template string users,

3596
04:22:41,120 --> 04:22:44,320
because that's the endpoint that we're using.

3597
04:22:44,320 --> 04:22:47,760
And we're also passing in user ID as well.

3598
04:22:48,640 --> 04:22:55,200
The method is going to be put and body is going to be updated user.

3599
04:22:55,200 --> 04:23:06,480
And finally, we are going to invalidate tags of users, which we do not have just.

3600
04:23:06,480 --> 04:23:10,480
So this part invalidates tags.

3601
04:23:10,480 --> 04:23:18,400
That means that anytime we update a list of users, the entire users list will be refetched.

3602
04:23:18,400 --> 04:23:22,560
If we do have a list of users, but in this case, we're not really refetching it.

3603
04:23:22,560 --> 04:23:24,640
So it's not a big concern.

3604
04:23:24,640 --> 04:23:26,080
So you don't have to worry about it right now.

3605
04:23:26,080 --> 04:23:29,600
All right, with this, we can scroll down.

3606
04:23:29,600 --> 04:23:36,240
And because this is a mutation request, instead of being it use update user query,

3607
04:23:36,240 --> 04:23:38,480
it's going to be mutation.

3608
04:23:38,480 --> 04:23:42,160
So use update user mutation for this.

3609
04:23:42,160 --> 04:23:47,840
Now we can go over here, go to our app, go to our dashboard.

3610
04:23:47,840 --> 04:23:51,840
And inside users, we can create a new folder, we can call this settings.

3611
04:23:51,840 --> 04:23:54,720
And we can do the same thing in teachers.

3612
04:23:54,720 --> 04:24:01,840
But let's actually create a file called page.tsx in our user page.

3613
04:24:01,840 --> 04:24:04,240
And I'm going to do rafce.

3614
04:24:04,240 --> 04:24:07,840
This is going to be user settings.

3615
04:24:07,840 --> 04:24:17,360
And inside here, I'm just going to do, I'm going to close this out, give it a class name.

3616
04:24:18,160 --> 04:24:21,120
Of width of three feet, like this.

3617
04:24:21,120 --> 04:24:29,440
Now inside of this div, we're going to have shared notification settings.

3618
04:24:29,440 --> 04:24:36,320
And we're doing this because this page will be exactly the same in the teacher page as well.

3619
04:24:36,320 --> 04:24:41,520
So we just want to be able to share this component and be reused for both those pages.

3620
04:24:41,520 --> 04:24:45,120
So we're just going to leave it like that.

3621
04:24:45,120 --> 04:24:47,840
So we're just going to leave it like this.

3622
04:24:47,840 --> 04:24:50,560
And I'm going to go to components page.

3623
04:24:50,560 --> 04:24:58,640
And we're going to create a file called this shared notification settings.tsx.

3624
04:24:58,640 --> 04:25:07,520
All right, so inside here, I'm going to do rafce shared notification settings.

3625
04:25:07,520 --> 04:25:10,240
And we're going to have an object.

3626
04:25:10,240 --> 04:25:11,440
And this is going to be title.

3627
04:25:12,000 --> 04:25:18,880
And by default, we're going to give it a notification settings as the text.

3628
04:25:18,880 --> 04:25:26,800
And subtitle is going to be manage your notification settings.

3629
04:25:26,800 --> 04:25:30,000
So if you wanted to change it, you're able to with these props.

3630
04:25:30,000 --> 04:25:34,560
And we're going to do colon shared notification settings props like this.

3631
04:25:34,560 --> 04:25:40,480
From here, we're going to grab the user information because that's where we get

3632
04:25:41,120 --> 04:25:43,200
our clerk information over here.

3633
04:25:43,200 --> 04:25:50,480
And then we're also going to grab update user from as an array.

3634
04:25:50,480 --> 04:25:56,960
And we grab it from use update user mutation.

3635
04:25:56,960 --> 04:25:59,840
And we're going to grab it from the API file that we created.

3636
04:25:59,840 --> 04:26:04,720
So this is exactly how we update our user.

3637
04:26:04,720 --> 04:26:09,840
Note that this is slightly different from what we've seen before.

3638
04:26:11,840 --> 04:26:14,720
When we go to non dashboard, we go landing page.

3639
04:26:14,720 --> 04:26:20,000
This is an object and we have data is loading is error.

3640
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:22,240
Those are destructured from an object.

3641
04:26:22,240 --> 04:26:26,320
Whereas over here with the mutation, this is an array.

3642
04:26:26,320 --> 04:26:32,400
And this first element is going to be a way this is a function that we can invoke

3643
04:26:32,400 --> 04:26:34,800
to update our user on the back end.

3644
04:26:36,320 --> 04:26:40,880
All right, so from here, we're going to grab current settings.

3645
04:26:40,880 --> 04:26:46,640
And we're just going to do user question mark dot public metadata.

3646
04:26:46,640 --> 04:26:51,920
And we kind of have to do all this weird funky stuff because of TypeScript yelling at us.

3647
04:26:51,920 --> 04:26:57,680
We're going to set this as user settings like so with question mark dot settings.

3648
04:26:57,680 --> 04:27:03,680
And we're going to give it an empty object just so TypeScript doesn't yell at us

3649
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:05,200
if it doesn't exist.

3650
04:27:06,240 --> 04:27:12,160
And then now here, because the user settings, if you look, take a look, this is a form

3651
04:27:12,160 --> 04:27:19,600
and forms we're going to be using Zod as well as ShadCN forms, which is also using

3652
04:27:19,600 --> 04:27:20,960
React hook forms.

3653
04:27:20,960 --> 04:27:23,280
So it's a lot of libraries combined together.

3654
04:27:23,280 --> 04:27:29,440
But the way we start is we're going to set up methods and we're going to grab use form

3655
04:27:29,440 --> 04:27:32,480
from React hook form.

3656
04:27:33,760 --> 04:27:40,000
And inside here, I'm going to do notification settings form data because we have already

3657
04:27:40,000 --> 04:27:41,280
created the schemas.

3658
04:27:41,280 --> 04:27:45,520
We've already passed that in because it's kind of a hassle not to do so.

3659
04:27:45,520 --> 04:27:51,920
So if you look, go to the schema page, you can see this is our notification setting schema,

3660
04:27:51,920 --> 04:27:58,160
of course, notification Boolean email alerts is a Boolean SMS alerts are Boolean notification

3661
04:27:58,160 --> 04:28:00,960
frequency is an enum with those values.

3662
04:28:00,960 --> 04:28:07,120
We're just basically making that into a type, passing it in over here, and we're using it

3663
04:28:07,120 --> 04:28:08,160
as part of the form.

3664
04:28:08,160 --> 04:28:10,720
All right.

3665
04:28:10,720 --> 04:28:16,160
So in here, we're going to grab the resolver property and then we're going to grab Zod

3666
04:28:16,160 --> 04:28:16,800
resolver.

3667
04:28:16,800 --> 04:28:24,960
Which we're going to have to import manually, we're going to do import Zod resolver and

3668
04:28:24,960 --> 04:28:32,480
we're going to import from at hook form slash resolvers slash Zod.

3669
04:28:32,480 --> 04:28:40,160
And then from here, we can pass in notification settings schema directly from our files, and

3670
04:28:40,160 --> 04:28:48,720
then we can do default values and we can pass in course notifications, which will be current

3671
04:28:49,840 --> 04:28:53,360
settings dot course notifications.

3672
04:28:53,360 --> 04:28:55,360
Otherwise, it's going to be false.

3673
04:28:55,360 --> 04:28:58,480
Just so we have something to set.

3674
04:28:58,480 --> 04:29:00,160
I'm just going to copy.

3675
04:29:00,160 --> 04:29:05,600
Let's actually copy this entire line, paste it four times, but we're going to be changing

3676
04:29:05,600 --> 04:29:06,640
some of these.

3677
04:29:06,640 --> 04:29:10,720
So this course notifications is going to be email alerts like so.

3678
04:29:12,720 --> 04:29:14,880
Next line is going to be SMS.

3679
04:29:14,880 --> 04:29:17,460
Alerts.

3680
04:29:17,460 --> 04:29:21,920
And the last one is going to be notification frequency.

3681
04:29:21,920 --> 04:29:26,320
This value should be daily as a default.

3682
04:29:26,320 --> 04:29:33,760
So when you do the forms, you're going to have to also have an on submit function.

3683
04:29:33,760 --> 04:29:35,120
So let's create that.

3684
04:29:35,120 --> 04:29:41,920
So on submit is equal to async data, colon notification settings, form data.

3685
04:29:41,920 --> 04:29:48,240
We're going to pass that in, have an arrow function, and we're going to say if user does

3686
04:29:48,240 --> 04:29:55,280
not exist, we're just going to return just to make sure the user has been identified.

3687
04:29:55,280 --> 04:29:58,480
And then we're also going to do updated user.

3688
04:29:58,480 --> 04:30:04,000
We're going to have an object and this is what we're going to pass into the back end,

3689
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:05,760
which is going to be the user ID.

3690
04:30:05,760 --> 04:30:07,600
So user.id like so.

3691
04:30:07,600 --> 04:30:12,960
And then we're also going to pass in the public metadata as we mentioned before.

3692
04:30:12,960 --> 04:30:16,720
We're going to grab the user.publicmetadata.

3693
04:30:16,720 --> 04:30:22,400
This is mostly so we can retain what was already existing in the public metadata.

3694
04:30:22,400 --> 04:30:28,000
But then we grab the settings and we're going to pass in the current settings.

3695
04:30:28,000 --> 04:30:30,880
So anything that's changed in this particular form.

3696
04:30:32,960 --> 04:30:37,200
And we're also going to pass in the new data that we get.

3697
04:30:37,200 --> 04:30:40,880
So current settings is what we already have currently.

3698
04:30:40,880 --> 04:30:44,320
And then the data is going to be the new information that we have.

3699
04:30:44,320 --> 04:30:46,640
All right.

3700
04:30:46,640 --> 04:30:52,400
So right below the updated user, we're going to have a try catch block and we can just

3701
04:30:52,400 --> 04:30:57,840
run a wait update user with updated user.

3702
04:30:57,840 --> 04:31:06,240
So by the way, again, we grab this update user from use update user mutation.

3703
04:31:06,240 --> 04:31:12,720
And over here we have this particular error and that's because if we go back to API,

3704
04:31:12,720 --> 04:31:17,680
this user object is the wrong one.

3705
04:31:17,680 --> 04:31:21,120
So we actually need to import this directly.

3706
04:31:21,120 --> 04:31:30,960
So import user from at clerk slash next JS slash server.

3707
04:31:30,960 --> 04:31:35,280
So once we have that, this should be OK now.

3708
04:31:35,280 --> 04:31:39,600
And we can just do catch with error object like so.

3709
04:31:39,600 --> 04:31:49,520
And we can just say console error failed to update user settings colon error like so.

3710
04:31:51,200 --> 04:31:57,920
Over here, I can just say if user does not exist, we are just going to return a div that

3711
04:31:57,920 --> 04:32:03,520
says please sign in to manage your settings.

3712
04:32:03,520 --> 04:32:05,760
All right.

3713
04:32:05,760 --> 04:32:08,720
So from here, we can add a class name.

3714
04:32:08,720 --> 04:32:13,680
We can pass in notification settings as the class.

3715
04:32:13,680 --> 04:32:18,480
And we're going to erase this shared notification settings.

3716
04:32:18,480 --> 04:32:25,200
We're going to pass in a header with title being the title that we defined earlier from

3717
04:32:25,200 --> 04:32:29,920
the props and that subtitle is going to be subtitle over here.

3718
04:32:29,920 --> 04:32:35,840
We're going to close that and we're going to make sure Heather is being imported from

3719
04:32:35,840 --> 04:32:36,400
components.

3720
04:32:36,400 --> 04:32:39,120
We're going to save that.

3721
04:32:39,120 --> 04:32:43,040
And just to check, let's go to our user page.

3722
04:32:43,040 --> 04:32:46,320
We're going to just define the title and subtitle over here.

3723
04:32:46,320 --> 04:32:54,560
So I'm going to say title is going to be user settings and subtitle is going to be manage

3724
04:32:54,560 --> 04:32:57,280
your user notification settings.

3725
04:32:57,280 --> 04:33:01,200
And we're going to make sure we import that.

3726
04:33:01,200 --> 04:33:08,240
So and then from here, we can actually go to our application.

3727
04:33:08,240 --> 04:33:10,640
Let's make sure everything is running.

3728
04:33:10,640 --> 04:33:12,560
And it is.

3729
04:33:12,560 --> 04:33:17,600
So if we now go to our sidebar that we can go, we can go directly to the settings page.

3730
04:33:17,600 --> 04:33:22,720
And what we get is this basic unhandled error runtime.

3731
04:33:22,720 --> 04:33:30,560
And that's because if we go back to shared notification settings, it needs to be a client

3732
04:33:30,560 --> 04:33:31,120
component.

3733
04:33:31,120 --> 04:33:34,480
And we can see we have our Heather.

3734
04:33:34,480 --> 04:33:35,920
All right.

3735
04:33:35,920 --> 04:33:40,640
So from here, we're going to go scroll down and we're going to now create our form.

3736
04:33:41,280 --> 04:33:48,080
Now, we are using form from React hook form, but Shad CN's version of React hook form.

3737
04:33:48,080 --> 04:33:52,720
So not the React hook form that we want.

3738
04:33:52,720 --> 04:34:02,720
We want the UI form that we're going to grab from at components slash UI slash form.

3739
04:34:02,720 --> 04:34:08,000
This is a specific type of form that Shad CN has.

3740
04:34:08,000 --> 04:34:13,200
That's kind of like abstracted over on top of React hook form that you can use.

3741
04:34:13,200 --> 04:34:18,880
And we're going to pass in dot dot dot the methods that we created earlier.

3742
04:34:18,880 --> 04:34:24,560
And then we're also going to encase that with the form HTML.

3743
04:34:24,560 --> 04:34:32,160
So we're going to have on submit and we're going to pass in methods dot handle submit

3744
04:34:33,840 --> 04:34:39,760
with the on submit function that we created earlier.

3745
04:34:39,760 --> 04:34:46,320
And we're going to pass in class name is going to be notification dash settings,

3746
04:34:46,320 --> 04:34:48,560
double underscore form.

3747
04:34:48,560 --> 04:34:50,720
And we're going to close this like this.

3748
04:34:50,720 --> 04:34:57,040
So right now, we don't have our form set up.

3749
04:34:58,560 --> 04:35:04,720
And then from here, we are going to use something that I imported earlier from our assets.

3750
04:35:04,720 --> 04:35:09,840
So from our asset file, I created this custom form field that we had.

3751
04:35:09,840 --> 04:35:16,800
And this includes a long list of form fields where we're going to have different types,

3752
04:35:16,800 --> 04:35:20,000
like text area, select, switch.

3753
04:35:20,000 --> 04:35:23,920
So we have different type of inputs that we can use in this form field.

3754
04:35:23,920 --> 04:35:25,440
This is something I created.

3755
04:35:25,440 --> 04:35:30,080
I might create this into like a library, but this makes it a lot easier.

3756
04:35:30,080 --> 04:35:35,920
And the code is a lot simpler than doing all the shad CN component inputs,

3757
04:35:35,920 --> 04:35:40,240
because it makes it very, very verbose if you were to write this.

3758
04:35:40,240 --> 04:35:42,320
But this makes it so it's super simple.

3759
04:35:42,320 --> 04:35:45,760
We do need to install a few things.

3760
04:35:45,760 --> 04:35:49,120
So we're going to install all of these.

3761
04:35:49,120 --> 04:35:50,560
So I'm going to cancel out.

3762
04:35:51,200 --> 04:36:01,120
I'm going to install npm iReactFilePond, FilePondPluginImage-Preview,

3763
04:36:01,120 --> 04:36:07,360
and then FilePondPluginImageExifOrientation.

3764
04:36:07,360 --> 04:36:09,200
This is all for images, by the way.

3765
04:36:09,200 --> 04:36:14,560
And I'm going to do legacy-peer-deps.

3766
04:36:14,560 --> 04:36:17,200
Make sure we install all of those.

3767
04:36:17,840 --> 04:36:23,440
We're going to run npm run dev and go back to our shared notification settings.

3768
04:36:23,440 --> 04:36:28,800
And with this set up, I'm going to create a div called class name

3769
04:36:28,800 --> 04:36:32,560
with notification-settings_fields.

3770
04:36:32,560 --> 04:36:40,560
Pass that in and we're going to pass in custom form field from our components.

3771
04:36:40,560 --> 04:36:43,760
And we can do something like npm run dev.

3772
04:36:43,760 --> 04:36:49,920
From our components and we can do something like name course notifications

3773
04:36:49,920 --> 04:36:56,320
with the label of course notifications.

3774
04:36:56,320 --> 04:37:00,080
And we are going to use type is equal to switch.

3775
04:37:00,080 --> 04:37:02,880
And I'm going to close that out.

3776
04:37:02,880 --> 04:37:10,800
And once we refresh this particular page, we get can't resolve FilePond.

3777
04:37:10,800 --> 04:37:21,760
And that's because I do need to install npm FilePond like so with legacy-peer-deps like that.

3778
04:37:21,760 --> 04:37:26,240
We're going to do npm run dev once again.

3779
04:37:26,240 --> 04:37:28,080
And there you go.

3780
04:37:28,080 --> 04:37:29,360
We have course notifications.

3781
04:37:29,360 --> 04:37:32,800
So if you see here, we don't see anything.

3782
04:37:32,800 --> 04:37:39,200
That's because we need to go and modify our switch component from our ShadCN.

3783
04:37:40,400 --> 04:37:44,160
Because it is it doesn't show the color right away.

3784
04:37:44,160 --> 04:37:55,520
So we need to set this to be data state is equal to checked with a background primary 700 like so.

3785
04:37:55,520 --> 04:38:00,080
And also data we need to put another string.

3786
04:38:00,080 --> 04:38:05,280
We're going to do data of state is equal to unchecked.

3787
04:38:06,000 --> 04:38:13,280
Give it a background of custom grays, dirty gray, comma, save that.

3788
04:38:13,280 --> 04:38:21,680
And over here on the next line, we're going to do a comma, bg gray of 100.

3789
04:38:21,680 --> 04:38:27,680
And we need to make sure that there is a closing brace like that.

3790
04:38:27,680 --> 04:38:33,200
And if we do that, we can see that we now have our switch component.

3791
04:38:34,560 --> 04:38:40,000
So yeah, so this custom form field makes it super easy for us to make inputs.

3792
04:38:40,000 --> 04:38:43,680
And it's already directly connected to our use form.

3793
04:38:43,680 --> 04:38:50,720
So let's say we want to do email alerts, SMS alerts like this.

3794
04:38:50,720 --> 04:38:55,520
I can just grab this, say it's email alerts.

3795
04:38:55,520 --> 04:39:00,400
Pass this email alerts like this.

3796
04:39:00,400 --> 04:39:03,760
And then we're going to have another Boolean.

3797
04:39:03,760 --> 04:39:06,320
And then finally, we need to switch the last one.

3798
04:39:06,320 --> 04:39:08,880
SMS alerts.

3799
04:39:08,880 --> 04:39:16,080
And then I'm just going to pass this as SMS alerts like so.

3800
04:39:16,080 --> 04:39:20,720
This makes it super easy for us to use.

3801
04:39:20,720 --> 04:39:25,120
And finally, we are going to have another custom form field.

3802
04:39:25,120 --> 04:39:29,440
But this time it's going to be a switch input or not a switch input.

3803
04:39:29,440 --> 04:39:31,520
It's going to be a select drop down.

3804
04:39:31,520 --> 04:39:34,320
So I'm going to set this to be notification frequency.

3805
04:39:34,320 --> 04:39:39,600
The label is going to be notification frequency.

3806
04:39:39,600 --> 04:39:43,360
And the type is going to be select.

3807
04:39:43,360 --> 04:39:47,920
Yes, I did create this to make it a lot easier.

3808
04:39:47,920 --> 04:39:50,080
So it has all these different type of inputs.

3809
04:39:50,080 --> 04:39:53,280
It doesn't have everything and it's not fully comprehensive.

3810
04:39:53,280 --> 04:39:58,000
But once I have a lot of this set up, I might just create a library,

3811
04:39:58,000 --> 04:39:59,120
separate library for this.

3812
04:39:59,120 --> 04:40:00,880
So you guys can download.

3813
04:40:00,880 --> 04:40:06,720
So making forms, especially in videos like this, it takes too much time.

3814
04:40:06,720 --> 04:40:08,560
And I don't think there's a lot of value.

3815
04:40:08,560 --> 04:40:12,400
So I think it's better for me to abstract some of that process

3816
04:40:12,400 --> 04:40:14,160
so we can focus more on the logic.

3817
04:40:14,160 --> 04:40:18,560
So with the select drop down, we can do value.

3818
04:40:18,560 --> 04:40:27,760
I'm going to put an immediate with the label of immediate like so with the string.

3819
04:40:28,960 --> 04:40:33,280
I'm going to copy this, paste it three times,

3820
04:40:33,280 --> 04:40:43,120
and we're going to change this to daily and this one to weekly.

3821
04:40:43,120 --> 04:40:47,680
Make sure we capitalize this label as well as weekly.

3822
04:40:47,680 --> 04:40:52,720
And once we save it, we can see that we have a notification frequency

3823
04:40:52,720 --> 04:40:55,680
with a drop down that looks pretty nice.

3824
04:40:56,720 --> 04:41:01,280
And then right below this div, we also obviously need a button.

3825
04:41:01,280 --> 04:41:03,120
We can say type is equal to submit.

3826
04:41:03,120 --> 04:41:09,120
And we're going to class name is going to be notification dash settings.

3827
04:41:09,120 --> 04:41:12,560
Underscore submit.

3828
04:41:12,560 --> 04:41:15,920
And we can do update settings.

3829
04:41:15,920 --> 04:41:24,080
But this button component is not defined, so we need to import that.

3830
04:41:24,880 --> 04:41:28,560
I'm going to go back up, change this to at slash components.

3831
04:41:28,560 --> 04:41:33,200
And now we should be pretty good with our user settings.

3832
04:41:33,200 --> 04:41:37,840
Now, let's say I change this email alerts.

3833
04:41:37,840 --> 04:41:41,920
Let's see if this particularly works.

3834
04:41:41,920 --> 04:41:48,480
So we're going to open this up, click network, and I'm going to hit update settings.

3835
04:41:48,480 --> 04:41:52,320
And we do get one specific error.

3836
04:41:52,320 --> 04:41:55,040
And that's because we do need a data object.

3837
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:57,200
And it seems like I did make a mistake.

3838
04:41:57,200 --> 04:42:00,960
So if I go over here, close all of this out.

3839
04:42:00,960 --> 04:42:08,320
Let's go to our back end, go back to our server controller with user clerk controller.

3840
04:42:08,320 --> 04:42:10,800
And we're just going to set data.

3841
04:42:10,800 --> 04:42:19,520
We can say this is const user is equal to await.

3842
04:42:19,520 --> 04:42:21,840
And we're just going to pass in user as well.

3843
04:42:23,200 --> 04:42:24,720
So we're going to refresh the page.

3844
04:42:24,720 --> 04:42:29,600
And I'm going to hit SMS alerts and hit update settings.

3845
04:42:29,600 --> 04:42:31,760
And now we don't get any issues.

3846
04:42:31,760 --> 04:42:38,640
So the way we can check that it's working is if we refresh the page, everything should be saved.

3847
04:42:38,640 --> 04:42:41,520
If it resets, then it's not done correctly.

3848
04:42:41,520 --> 04:42:45,760
So this is how easy it is to create a form if we're using a lot of these.

3849
04:42:45,760 --> 04:42:48,800
It's abstracted quite a bit.

3850
04:42:49,360 --> 04:42:53,680
But basically, if we use all of this, it makes it super easy to create forms,

3851
04:42:53,680 --> 04:42:57,120
which are probably one of the more time consuming aspects,

3852
04:42:57,120 --> 04:43:00,560
especially with front end and connecting it to your back end.

3853
04:43:00,560 --> 04:43:07,280
And now we do have, we're going to close all of this, go to our settings page.

3854
04:43:07,280 --> 04:43:10,400
We already have this for user.

3855
04:43:10,400 --> 04:43:15,520
But we want to copy this to teacher because it's going to be exactly the same.

3856
04:43:15,520 --> 04:43:18,160
Just a little minor change.

3857
04:43:18,160 --> 04:43:20,720
So I'm going to paste it into teachers.

3858
04:43:20,720 --> 04:43:22,640
We're going to go to this page.

3859
04:43:22,640 --> 04:43:28,640
And over here, I'm going to change this to be teacher settings.

3860
04:43:28,640 --> 04:43:32,880
And manager teacher notification settings.

3861
04:43:32,880 --> 04:43:37,200
And that's pretty much it.

3862
04:43:37,200 --> 04:43:43,280
Actually, we need to do change the user settings to be teacher settings like this.

3863
04:43:43,280 --> 04:43:45,840
And yeah.

3864
04:43:47,840 --> 04:43:50,400
Now there's two other things that I want to do,

3865
04:43:50,400 --> 04:43:54,000
which is the first thing is I want to secure our back end.

3866
04:43:54,000 --> 04:43:58,000
Because right now, if we go back to our back end,

3867
04:43:58,000 --> 04:44:03,920
if we go and hit list courses or get course, you can directly hit your back end.

3868
04:44:03,920 --> 04:44:10,880
But you want to have your back end API endpoints also secure with authentication.

3869
04:44:10,880 --> 04:44:17,200
Because you don't want random users to be able to hit your API endpoint and exploit it,

3870
04:44:17,200 --> 04:44:20,000
especially with user clerk information.

3871
04:44:20,000 --> 04:44:25,760
If someone's able to access this without authenticating,

3872
04:44:25,760 --> 04:44:29,360
they can update someone's user account, which is not very good.

3873
04:44:29,360 --> 04:44:33,600
We can leave list courses and get course.

3874
04:44:33,600 --> 04:44:37,600
You know, that is perfectly fine for someone to hit your endpoint.

3875
04:44:37,600 --> 04:44:39,360
You can secure it if you really want to,

3876
04:44:39,360 --> 04:44:41,920
if you worry about someone DDoSing your website.

3877
04:44:41,920 --> 04:44:47,040
Which is not that big of a concern when you're using something like DynamoDB.

3878
04:44:48,320 --> 04:44:50,480
But you probably should do it.

3879
04:44:50,480 --> 04:44:52,960
But for now, we're not going to secure this endpoint,

3880
04:44:52,960 --> 04:44:56,000
but we're going to definitely secure the update user.

3881
04:44:56,000 --> 04:45:01,840
So to do that, we're going to do right below our course,

3882
04:45:01,840 --> 04:45:05,360
we're going to do app.use_clerk_middleware.

3883
04:45:05,360 --> 04:45:08,560
And we're going to grab it from @clerk_express.

3884
04:45:08,560 --> 04:45:11,360
And we're going to execute it like that.

3885
04:45:12,640 --> 04:45:18,560
And then from here, what we want to do right here with users_clerk,

3886
04:45:18,560 --> 04:45:20,800
we want to secure this particular route.

3887
04:45:20,800 --> 04:45:25,600
So we're going to use require_auth from @clerk_express.

3888
04:45:25,600 --> 04:45:27,520
And we're going to invoke that.

3889
04:45:27,520 --> 04:45:34,800
So what happens now is if we actually try to update our backend,

3890
04:45:34,800 --> 04:45:38,960
let's say update settings, now we're going to get an error.

3891
04:45:38,960 --> 04:45:41,440
It's going to say publishable key not valid.

3892
04:45:43,280 --> 04:45:45,520
We aren't able to access it.

3893
04:45:45,520 --> 04:45:51,840
Let's say if I just got rid of it, we can do update settings, refresh it.

3894
04:45:51,840 --> 04:45:54,880
And if we are to remove the @clerk_middleware,

3895
04:45:54,880 --> 04:45:58,320
we are able to update the settings like this.

3896
04:45:58,320 --> 04:46:06,400
However, if we add it back again, add require_auth like so,

3897
04:46:06,400 --> 04:46:10,960
it's going to prevent us from accessing the backend.

3898
04:46:12,160 --> 04:46:13,760
So now we get this error.

3899
04:46:13,760 --> 04:46:16,480
So how do we authenticate the users?

3900
04:46:16,480 --> 04:46:22,320
So this is where Redux Toolkit API query is very, very nice.

3901
04:46:22,320 --> 04:46:26,000
We want to be able to authenticate for every single API call.

3902
04:46:26,000 --> 04:46:30,960
So we can now go back to our custom base query,

3903
04:46:30,960 --> 04:46:36,960
and we can add those authentication credentials to every single request

3904
04:46:36,960 --> 04:46:40,160
by going up here in the custom base query.

3905
04:46:40,560 --> 04:46:43,360
Oh, right here.

3906
04:46:43,360 --> 04:46:46,480
So if we go and write prepare headers,

3907
04:46:46,480 --> 04:46:54,960
actually, we should just get the property, colon, async, pass in headers like so,

3908
04:46:54,960 --> 04:47:02,720
with an arrow function like this, and we can just get token await is equal to await.

3909
04:47:03,600 --> 04:47:12,080
And we need to grab window.clerk session?get token.

3910
04:47:12,080 --> 04:47:16,800
So this is how you can grab the clerk session token.

3911
04:47:16,800 --> 04:47:25,440
For some reason, the linting doesn't work unless you import clerk from @clerk/clerkjs.

3912
04:47:25,440 --> 04:47:28,560
That's why we installed this one as well.

3913
04:47:28,560 --> 04:47:33,040
For some reason, it prevents it from doing anything, even though it's not really using it.

3914
04:47:34,320 --> 04:47:45,440
Anyways, if token exists, then we can set our headers to be set to authorization, comma,

3915
04:47:45,440 --> 04:47:52,880
bearer, and we're going to add token like this, and we're going to return headers.

3916
04:47:52,880 --> 04:47:57,840
Now, this is very common practice to prepare headers,

3917
04:47:57,840 --> 04:48:00,960
have it set to authorization with a bearer token.

3918
04:48:00,960 --> 04:48:02,640
Even Cognito does this.

3919
04:48:02,640 --> 04:48:10,080
So this is how you can make an API request to authenticate every single API that you have on

3920
04:48:10,080 --> 04:48:10,800
your back end.

3921
04:48:10,800 --> 04:48:21,600
So if I open this back up in our network tab, let's refresh to make sure everything is expected.

3922
04:48:21,600 --> 04:48:30,320
Let's say we remove those, update settings, and we do get error publishable key not valid.

3923
04:48:30,320 --> 04:48:36,560
So there is a bit of a misname on the .env.

3924
04:48:36,560 --> 04:48:44,080
We actually have to change next_public to clerk publishable key because this is on the back end.

3925
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:46,480
So obviously, we should not have done that.

3926
04:48:46,480 --> 04:48:53,600
And so let's refresh the page to double check everything is working, remove both of those,

3927
04:48:53,600 --> 04:48:59,840
and you're going to have to restart the server for your back end, which I did.

3928
04:48:59,840 --> 04:49:02,720
And as you can see, it finally worked.

3929
04:49:02,720 --> 04:49:10,320
So if I refresh it just one more time, click this, we can hit our endpoint because we now

3930
04:49:10,320 --> 04:49:12,080
have the authorization token.

3931
04:49:12,080 --> 04:49:18,400
So if I were to do this, we close this out, we change a few settings.

3932
04:49:18,400 --> 04:49:20,480
Let's say we turn it all off.

3933
04:49:20,480 --> 04:49:23,120
You can see we get an error.

3934
04:49:24,320 --> 04:49:31,920
But if we were to uncomment this out and I change these settings, it should now work.

3935
04:49:31,920 --> 04:49:33,760
User updated successfully.

3936
04:49:33,760 --> 04:49:36,400
So this is our headers in action.

3937
04:49:36,400 --> 04:49:39,600
And you want to be able to authenticate for every single route.

3938
04:49:39,600 --> 04:49:43,680
That's why we pass the authorization token when we call our back end.

3939
04:49:43,680 --> 04:49:47,680
This is one of the beauties of Redux Toolkit Query.

3940
04:49:47,680 --> 04:49:50,000
It makes it super simple to do things like this.

3941
04:49:51,040 --> 04:49:56,640
And it is a very common pattern with authentication secure type security.

3942
04:49:56,640 --> 04:50:02,640
So one thing that is still missing from this application is when you update settings,

3943
04:50:02,640 --> 04:50:06,800
we're not getting, we might get feedback in our console.

3944
04:50:06,800 --> 04:50:11,360
We know that a network request is being sent because we see the server.

3945
04:50:11,360 --> 04:50:14,480
But for the user, they don't know if something happened.

3946
04:50:14,480 --> 04:50:17,280
So we want to have like a toast notification.

3947
04:50:17,280 --> 04:50:21,280
So if you look on ShadCN, we have, if we hit add to calendar,

3948
04:50:21,280 --> 04:50:24,400
you can see that there's this notification that popped up over here.

3949
04:50:24,400 --> 04:50:28,080
So we want to do something like this.

3950
04:50:28,080 --> 04:50:31,760
However, I recommend not using the toast component in ShadCN.

3951
04:50:31,760 --> 04:50:36,080
Rather, the sonar component in ShadCN.

3952
04:50:36,080 --> 04:50:42,080
Because if you show toast, you can actually combine and you can see multiple of the notifications.

3953
04:50:42,080 --> 04:50:44,400
Otherwise, toast is just a singular one.

3954
04:50:44,400 --> 04:50:46,880
So just be aware.

3955
04:50:46,880 --> 04:50:51,920
I got confused one time, but sonar is a way to have multiple notifications.

3956
04:50:51,920 --> 04:50:54,960
And it's a very nice UI for something like this.

3957
04:50:54,960 --> 04:51:02,240
And so again, I want to brag about how nice Redux toolkit query API is.

3958
04:51:02,240 --> 04:51:03,920
I'll show you in just a second.

3959
04:51:03,920 --> 04:51:07,680
But the first thing we want to do is set up our layout.

3960
04:51:07,680 --> 04:51:14,080
So for our toast notification, we need to go down right below our div.

3961
04:51:14,800 --> 04:51:16,880
We want to pass in toaster.

3962
04:51:16,880 --> 04:51:24,640
And we're going to set rich colors and close button like this.

3963
04:51:24,640 --> 04:51:32,320
And we are going to import toaster from sonar.

3964
04:51:32,320 --> 04:51:41,360
And this is one of those things I need to make sure we install npm isonar.

3965
04:51:42,880 --> 04:51:46,000
And don't forget the --legacypeerdeps.

3966
04:51:46,000 --> 04:51:54,000
And then rerun our server.

3967
04:51:54,000 --> 04:51:57,120
We're going to refresh this page.

3968
04:51:57,120 --> 04:52:00,320
So by default, obviously, this is not connected.

3969
04:52:00,320 --> 04:52:04,800
Doesn't mean that it's going to automatically know to create those notifications.

3970
04:52:04,800 --> 04:52:08,560
So this is where we go to our custom base query.

3971
04:52:08,560 --> 04:52:11,280
And we want to configure this appropriately.

3972
04:52:12,000 --> 04:52:15,520
So now there are a lot of API requests.

3973
04:52:15,520 --> 04:52:23,040
We want to not have -- if you go to our backend, and we go to course controller,

3974
04:52:23,040 --> 04:52:25,040
we have these messages.

3975
04:52:25,040 --> 04:52:28,640
And we want to display these messages if it succeeds.

3976
04:52:28,640 --> 04:52:33,600
However, we don't want to do it for any kind of like get request.

3977
04:52:33,600 --> 04:52:38,320
If we're just grabbing a list of courses, obviously, we don't want to show the message

3978
04:52:38,320 --> 04:52:38,640
for that.

3979
04:52:38,640 --> 04:52:39,680
Because that's kind of annoying.

3980
04:52:40,320 --> 04:52:46,560
We only want to show the message when we update or do some kind of mutation on the backend.

3981
04:52:46,560 --> 04:52:50,880
When we update a user, you know, delete a user or create a user.

3982
04:52:50,880 --> 04:52:51,920
Things like that.

3983
04:52:51,920 --> 04:52:54,800
Those are the times we want a success message.

3984
04:52:54,800 --> 04:52:58,880
Something like this where we do user settings and we hit update settings.

3985
04:52:58,880 --> 04:53:03,440
That's when we basically want the message to be shown.

3986
04:53:03,440 --> 04:53:07,280
And it's better to use the message that comes from the backend.

3987
04:53:07,280 --> 04:53:09,200
Because it's a lot easier.

3988
04:53:09,200 --> 04:53:15,520
And the way to do this is we can configure our custom base query to do something like

3989
04:53:15,520 --> 04:53:16,320
this.

3990
04:53:16,320 --> 04:53:21,520
So over here, right above the result data, let's close this out so we have more space.

3991
04:53:21,520 --> 04:53:24,960
We can say if result.error.

3992
04:53:24,960 --> 04:53:33,600
So any time our result from our -- any API call that we make, if we get some kind of

3993
04:53:33,600 --> 04:53:37,680
error, we want to make sure we check for that error.

3994
04:53:38,560 --> 04:53:42,560
Now that error can look like multiple different ways.

3995
04:53:42,560 --> 04:53:45,440
So we're just going to grab any kind of error message.

3996
04:53:45,440 --> 04:53:49,760
So error data question mark dot message.

3997
04:53:49,760 --> 04:53:51,520
So that is possible.

3998
04:53:51,520 --> 04:54:01,600
We can also get an error message saying result dot error status to string like this.

3999
04:54:01,600 --> 04:54:08,160
We can also just say an error occurred if we don't have anything else.

4000
04:54:09,200 --> 04:54:13,920
And we want to use that message for our toast error.

4001
04:54:13,920 --> 04:54:18,640
So now toast needs to be imported from Sunner.

4002
04:54:18,640 --> 04:54:24,480
We can grab this error message and we can say error like so.

4003
04:54:24,480 --> 04:54:28,480
Pass the error message over here.

4004
04:54:28,480 --> 04:54:34,480
By doing this, this applies for every single API request.

4005
04:54:34,480 --> 04:54:36,720
So any time we have an error, we can show that.

4006
04:54:37,840 --> 04:54:42,800
So now we also do want to check if it's a mutation type request.

4007
04:54:42,800 --> 04:54:48,640
And the way we do this is using use mutation request.

4008
04:54:48,640 --> 04:54:53,280
And we're going to bring in args as fetch args.

4009
04:54:53,280 --> 04:54:56,320
So these are just typings.

4010
04:54:56,320 --> 04:55:04,800
So we're going to grab the method property from args and args as fetch args.

4011
04:55:04,800 --> 04:55:07,840
Like so.

4012
04:55:07,840 --> 04:55:11,600
Again, this is just typing kind of a pain.

4013
04:55:11,600 --> 04:55:14,800
And if it does not equal to the get.

4014
04:55:14,800 --> 04:55:19,120
Basically, we're just grabbing this property method.

4015
04:55:19,120 --> 04:55:24,880
And if it's not equal to get, then we can say it is a mutation request.

4016
04:55:24,880 --> 04:55:30,240
And if is mutation request, what do we do?

4017
04:55:31,120 --> 04:55:37,440
We grab the success message, which is going to come from result.data.message like this.

4018
04:55:37,440 --> 04:55:42,800
We're going to grab if success message exists.

4019
04:55:42,800 --> 04:55:45,600
We are then going to pass it into toast success.

4020
04:55:45,600 --> 04:55:49,360
Success message like so.

4021
04:55:49,360 --> 04:55:55,840
And by doing this, we can see the results automatically.

4022
04:55:55,840 --> 04:55:59,920
We have in toast message user updated successfully.

4023
04:56:00,960 --> 04:56:09,520
And this is the beauty of both Redux toolkit query and our toast ShadCN component.

4024
04:56:09,520 --> 04:56:15,200
There's also one last thing that we need to add is just in case.

4025
04:56:15,200 --> 04:56:18,720
This is just the error handling that I've encountered.

4026
04:56:18,720 --> 04:56:21,760
I'm not exactly sure when this happens.

4027
04:56:21,760 --> 04:56:28,880
But if we get a 204, basically an empty object from the back end, we need to handle that edge case.

4028
04:56:30,320 --> 04:56:31,920
So this is how I solved it.

4029
04:56:31,920 --> 04:56:36,000
I'm not exactly sure on how this particular thing works.

4030
04:56:36,000 --> 04:56:43,040
But if this is the case, we just return with data.

4031
04:56:43,040 --> 04:56:46,080
No, this is basically handling content if we have no response.

4032
04:56:46,080 --> 04:56:54,320
And I did mess this up because that should not be curly braces and like this.

4033
04:56:54,320 --> 04:56:56,960
And so there we go.

4034
04:56:56,960 --> 04:57:02,720
We now have toast message for any time it's a successful mutation request.

4035
04:57:02,720 --> 04:57:07,840
And if we do receive an error, it's going to pop up as the error message.

4036
04:57:07,840 --> 04:57:09,520
But we haven't checked that.

4037
04:57:09,520 --> 04:57:14,160
But that will it'll probably happen at some point and you'll be able to see the error message.

4038
04:57:14,160 --> 04:57:14,880
And it's pretty nice.

4039
04:57:14,880 --> 04:57:19,280
So this is our custom base query.

4040
04:57:19,280 --> 04:57:21,440
Focus on the checkout.

4041
04:57:22,080 --> 04:57:28,000
The checkout flow is a little bit complicated, but it is definitely manageable.

4042
04:57:28,000 --> 04:57:33,600
So basically, when you go to the first checkout page, we're going to see the course that we've

4043
04:57:33,600 --> 04:57:34,640
have chosen.

4044
04:57:34,640 --> 04:57:36,640
We're going to see a guest checkout.

4045
04:57:36,640 --> 04:57:38,560
Now, this is not going to be functional.

4046
04:57:38,560 --> 04:57:42,720
This is just something I create, but the scope got out of hand.

4047
04:57:42,720 --> 04:57:45,760
So I'm just going to use this authentication.

4048
04:57:45,760 --> 04:57:51,600
So basically, when the user signs up, hits continue, they're going to be taken to this

4049
04:57:51,600 --> 04:57:52,480
particular page.

4050
04:57:52,480 --> 04:57:58,400
If they receive this page, then we have this stripe checkout.

4051
04:57:58,400 --> 04:58:04,560
So this stripe checkout allows us to get user information for the credit card or billing

4052
04:58:04,560 --> 04:58:05,120
information.

4053
04:58:05,120 --> 04:58:11,520
And once they hit pay with credit card, it's going to do multiple things.

4054
04:58:11,520 --> 04:58:17,120
First of all, it's going to take them to the completed page if everything goes successfully.

4055
04:58:17,120 --> 04:58:20,560
But it also will create multiple things.

4056
04:58:20,560 --> 04:58:23,360
I know there's quite a lot of things that happen.

4057
04:58:23,360 --> 04:58:27,520
So when we pay with credit card, it's going to create a stripe payment, and it's going

4058
04:58:27,520 --> 04:58:29,360
to go directly to stripe.

4059
04:58:29,360 --> 04:58:34,320
So it's going to create like an actual payment over there, and it's going to handle the transaction.

4060
04:58:34,320 --> 04:58:40,880
But it's also going to create a transaction so the user can fetch transaction records

4061
04:58:40,880 --> 04:58:41,520
later.

4062
04:58:41,520 --> 04:58:44,240
So this is a transaction database that we have.

4063
04:58:44,240 --> 04:58:50,800
So if we ever need to grab transactions or information about the payment that was made

4064
04:58:50,800 --> 04:58:54,720
and the course, we are saving it into our transaction database.

4065
04:58:54,720 --> 04:59:01,520
And that is later going to be used for our payment history page where it shows the amount

4066
04:59:01,520 --> 04:59:02,720
and the payment method.

4067
04:59:02,720 --> 04:59:08,560
Furthermore, we also need to add the user to the course.

4068
04:59:08,560 --> 04:59:12,400
So in our course database, we're going to add an enrollment to the course.

4069
04:59:12,640 --> 04:59:19,760
And also, we also need to add progress data for the initial course enrollment.

4070
04:59:19,760 --> 04:59:20,960
So user course progress.

4071
04:59:20,960 --> 04:59:22,960
So I'll cover this a little more.

4072
04:59:22,960 --> 04:59:32,080
This plays into, plays more of a role into when the user is viewing the video and it

4073
04:59:32,080 --> 04:59:33,440
tracks the progress.

4074
04:59:33,440 --> 04:59:35,760
This is going to play a role in that case.

4075
04:59:36,800 --> 04:59:42,880
So later on, when we go to my courses, this is how we check if the course has been created.

4076
04:59:42,880 --> 04:59:47,760
So we are keeping track of that in our databases.

4077
04:59:47,760 --> 04:59:51,120
So that is essentially our checkout flow.

4078
04:59:51,120 --> 04:59:55,600
It's a little complicated when completing the order, but we needed to save all that

4079
04:59:55,600 --> 04:59:58,720
information so that we can access it later on.

4080
04:59:58,720 --> 05:00:05,840
So the first thing we need to do is I want you to create an account in Stripe.

4081
05:00:05,840 --> 05:00:09,600
So make sure you create an account in Stripe, follow the instructions.

4082
05:00:09,600 --> 05:00:13,040
And once you're ready, you're going to hit test mode.

4083
05:00:13,040 --> 05:00:15,360
You're going to make sure this is selected.

4084
05:00:15,360 --> 05:00:19,600
And also you want to select developers.

4085
05:00:19,600 --> 05:00:25,840
And we're going to go and select API keys so we can see the publishable key and the

4086
05:00:25,840 --> 05:00:26,400
secret key.

4087
05:00:26,400 --> 05:00:33,040
So when you have that, we are going to go to our env.local, close that up.

4088
05:00:34,000 --> 05:00:37,280
And I'm going to copy next_public.

4089
05:00:37,280 --> 05:00:39,840
We're going to write Stripe.

4090
05:00:39,840 --> 05:00:43,920
Make sure you spell it correctly.

4091
05:00:43,920 --> 05:00:44,720
We have public_key.

4092
05:00:44,720 --> 05:00:52,560
And we're going to just copy this value and paste it over here.

4093
05:00:54,720 --> 05:01:04,480
And then also we need a next_public, Stripe, redirect URL.

4094
05:01:04,480 --> 05:01:11,760
And the redirect URL is going to be the page where the Stripe is going to redirect to once

4095
05:01:11,760 --> 05:01:13,680
the transaction is completed.

4096
05:01:13,680 --> 05:01:22,880
So we are going to set this to be for now localhost 3000 checkout question mark step

4097
05:01:22,880 --> 05:01:23,200
three.

4098
05:01:23,200 --> 05:01:26,080
So this is the completed page that we just saw.

4099
05:01:26,080 --> 05:01:29,680
And then from here, we're going to go to our back end now.

4100
05:01:29,680 --> 05:01:31,760
We're going to go down to.env.

4101
05:01:31,760 --> 05:01:41,040
And here we're going to paste in the Stripe secret key.

4102
05:01:41,040 --> 05:01:44,080
Underscore key is equal to.

4103
05:01:44,080 --> 05:01:46,160
And we are going to copy this.

4104
05:01:46,160 --> 05:01:49,200
So I'm going to delete this secret key later on.

4105
05:01:50,480 --> 05:01:52,960
But make sure you have your own secret key.

4106
05:01:52,960 --> 05:01:53,680
Use that.

4107
05:01:53,680 --> 05:01:57,920
I know some people always accidentally use the same key that I have.

4108
05:01:57,920 --> 05:02:01,520
And I can see that these are all test keys.

4109
05:02:01,520 --> 05:02:04,720
You want to use your own so you have access to your own.

4110
05:02:04,720 --> 05:02:05,840
All right.

4111
05:02:05,840 --> 05:02:08,960
With all of that set up, we're going to close all of this.

4112
05:02:08,960 --> 05:02:10,960
Open up our terminal.

4113
05:02:10,960 --> 05:02:14,960
We're going to close our front end.

4114
05:02:15,680 --> 05:02:27,040
And we're going to install MPMI at Stripe slash react dash Stripe dash JS and then at

4115
05:02:27,040 --> 05:02:30,720
Stripe slash Stripe dash JS.

4116
05:02:30,720 --> 05:02:33,760
And you want to make sure we do legacy.

4117
05:02:33,760 --> 05:02:40,000
Peer DPS and make sure you spell Stripe correctly.

4118
05:02:40,000 --> 05:02:42,960
If you see, I have at Stripe.

4119
05:02:43,520 --> 05:02:45,680
It should be at Stripe right there.

4120
05:02:45,680 --> 05:02:52,480
And we're also going to go to our server and we're going to just do MPMI Stripe.

4121
05:02:52,480 --> 05:02:55,920
So from here, we're going to go to our back end.

4122
05:02:55,920 --> 05:03:00,400
We're going to go to controllers and we're going to create a new file.

4123
05:03:00,400 --> 05:03:04,640
And we're going to call this transaction controller dot TS.

4124
05:03:04,640 --> 05:03:07,440
We're going to close up the terminal.

4125
05:03:07,440 --> 05:03:12,320
And in here, I'm going to do several things.

4126
05:03:12,320 --> 05:03:17,120
So I'm going to import Stripe from Stripe package that we created.

4127
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:23,280
Then we're also going to import dot env because we want to use the environment variable.

4128
05:03:23,280 --> 05:03:32,080
And I'm going to invoke dot env dot config so we can actually use the environment variable.

4129
05:03:32,720 --> 05:03:42,560
And we're also going to do if process dot env dot Stripe secret underscore key.

4130
05:03:42,560 --> 05:03:48,640
We are going to throw new error.

4131
05:03:48,640 --> 05:03:51,280
Stripe secret.

4132
05:03:51,280 --> 05:03:53,920
Let's just copy this.

4133
05:03:55,440 --> 05:04:03,040
Paste it over here is required, but was not found in env variables.

4134
05:04:03,040 --> 05:04:11,280
And then below this, I'm going to say const Stripe is equal to new Stripe with process

4135
05:04:11,280 --> 05:04:13,920
dot env dot Stripe secret key.

4136
05:04:13,920 --> 05:04:19,840
So this is how we instantiate our Stripe variable so we can use it.

4137
05:04:20,560 --> 05:04:25,440
And so what we need to do is we need to create this create Stripe payment intent.

4138
05:04:25,440 --> 05:04:31,600
So this is if we want to use the Stripe payment system, we need to create a payment intent

4139
05:04:31,600 --> 05:04:36,080
on the back end, and we need to connect it to the front end as well.

4140
05:04:36,080 --> 05:04:40,480
So this is part of using Stripe and making sure everything works.

4141
05:04:40,480 --> 05:04:44,160
So we're going to do create Stripe payment intent.

4142
05:04:44,160 --> 05:04:49,760
We are going to do async with rec colon request.

4143
05:04:49,760 --> 05:04:56,880
That should be from Express and then res colon response.

4144
05:04:56,880 --> 05:05:00,160
That should be from Express as well.

4145
05:05:00,160 --> 05:05:02,800
So actually, we can go back to course controller.

4146
05:05:02,800 --> 05:05:05,520
I'm just going to copy and paste it.

4147
05:05:05,520 --> 05:05:08,640
We have everything.

4148
05:05:08,640 --> 05:05:13,840
So from promise, we're going to keep all of that like that.

4149
05:05:14,960 --> 05:05:22,960
Inside here, I'm going to do let amount is equal to rec dot body.

4150
05:05:22,960 --> 05:05:32,720
And we are also going to do if amount and amount is less than or equal to zero,

4151
05:05:32,720 --> 05:05:39,280
we are going to set to amount to be equal to 50, basically 50 cents.

4152
05:05:40,640 --> 05:05:44,080
The reason why we do this is because Stripe has a minimum of 50 cents.

4153
05:05:44,080 --> 05:05:46,000
There is.

4154
05:05:46,000 --> 05:05:53,680
I didn't get to the edge case, but you should be handling this on your own where you have

4155
05:05:53,680 --> 05:05:58,080
the amount in the course, like the course price should never be allowed to be set to

4156
05:05:58,080 --> 05:06:05,040
zero or if you have some kind of other configuration, we need to handle that edge case later on.

4157
05:06:05,040 --> 05:06:10,160
But for now, we're going to keep it like this so we don't get any kind of errors.

4158
05:06:11,120 --> 05:06:15,520
So we're going to remove all of this and we're going to say payment intent and we're going to

4159
05:06:15,520 --> 05:06:21,360
do a wait stripe dot payment intents dot create.

4160
05:06:21,360 --> 05:06:24,480
We're going to pass in the amount.

4161
05:06:24,480 --> 05:06:28,480
Currency is going to be in USD.

4162
05:06:28,480 --> 05:06:30,160
You can set it to whatever you want.

4163
05:06:30,160 --> 05:06:38,320
Automatic payment methods colon is going to be enabled to be true and allow redirects

4164
05:06:38,320 --> 05:06:39,520
should be never.

4165
05:06:41,280 --> 05:06:44,560
And finally, we do not want message.

4166
05:06:44,560 --> 05:06:52,080
Because we do not want like a message happening on the front end, so that's why we keep it

4167
05:06:52,080 --> 05:06:53,760
blank like that.

4168
05:06:53,760 --> 05:06:56,960
And in the data, we are going to.

4169
05:06:56,960 --> 05:07:05,760
Pass in the client secret, which is payment intent dot client secret.

4170
05:07:05,760 --> 05:07:12,400
So this gets sent to the front end and we want to use that for our information.

4171
05:07:12,400 --> 05:07:16,880
So over here we are just going to say error creating.

4172
05:07:16,880 --> 05:07:19,380
Stripe.

4173
05:07:19,380 --> 05:07:22,480
Payment intent.

4174
05:07:22,480 --> 05:07:29,840
All right, so this is necessary to make a connection to stripe when we first initialize

4175
05:07:29,840 --> 05:07:32,320
the stripe payment card checkout.

4176
05:07:32,320 --> 05:07:39,360
This is a very secure way and it fits into what's called the PCI DSS, you know, privacy

4177
05:07:39,360 --> 05:07:47,040
credit card information, making sure you are doing your handling users data in a very.

4178
05:07:47,040 --> 05:07:49,280
Safe way.

4179
05:07:49,280 --> 05:07:53,360
So with that, we created this endpoint.

4180
05:07:53,360 --> 05:08:00,160
We also need to create the routes, so we go to routes, create a new file.

4181
05:08:00,160 --> 05:08:03,920
We're going to create transaction routes dot TS.

4182
05:08:03,920 --> 05:08:11,520
And here we are going to copy everything from course, paste it over here so we can do the

4183
05:08:11,520 --> 05:08:12,400
same thing.

4184
05:08:12,400 --> 05:08:17,120
So here the endpoint is going to be stripe.

4185
05:08:17,120 --> 05:08:18,900
Slash.

4186
05:08:18,900 --> 05:08:20,180
Payment.

4187
05:08:20,180 --> 05:08:29,120
Dash intent and the rather should not be get it should be post and we are going to grab

4188
05:08:29,120 --> 05:08:36,880
create stripe payment intent from the controllers, remove all of these and remove this endpoint

4189
05:08:36,880 --> 05:08:37,380
right here.

4190
05:08:37,380 --> 05:08:44,160
And finally, we can now go to the index page, go to our routes and we're going to do app

4191
05:08:44,160 --> 05:08:44,800
dot use.

4192
05:08:44,800 --> 05:08:48,320
We're going to pass in slash transactions.

4193
05:08:48,320 --> 05:08:54,320
This should be definitely authenticated, so we are going to use require.

4194
05:08:55,200 --> 05:09:01,440
Off like so and we are going to pass in transaction routes which are not.

4195
05:09:01,440 --> 05:09:04,640
Defined, so we're going to go up here.

4196
05:09:04,640 --> 05:09:06,720
Transaction routes.

4197
05:09:06,720 --> 05:09:11,840
From dot slash routes.

4198
05:09:11,840 --> 05:09:14,800
Slash transaction routes like that.

4199
05:09:14,800 --> 05:09:19,280
OK, so now we can go back to our front end.

4200
05:09:19,280 --> 05:09:22,880
We can go to API dot TS and over here.

4201
05:09:23,680 --> 05:09:24,720
We can Scroll down.

4202
05:09:24,720 --> 05:09:31,280
And we can go over here and we can create a new endpoint and we're going to call this

4203
05:09:31,280 --> 05:09:34,480
crate stripe payment intent.

4204
05:09:34,480 --> 05:09:41,040
And like before, since now we've already have this example, we're just going to copy

4205
05:09:41,040 --> 05:09:46,400
this build mutation, paste it over here and we can modify things as we go.

4206
05:09:46,400 --> 05:09:47,840
So right here.

4207
05:09:47,840 --> 05:09:52,240
Instead of this being a user, this is going to be client.

4208
05:09:53,680 --> 05:09:55,520
Secret should be a string.

4209
05:09:55,520 --> 05:10:02,960
And then on this next line, this should be amount colon number.

4210
05:10:02,960 --> 05:10:07,120
In the query instead of user ID, this should be amount.

4211
05:10:07,120 --> 05:10:14,320
And with the URL is going to be slash transactions.

4212
05:10:14,320 --> 05:10:16,160
Slash stripe.

4213
05:10:16,160 --> 05:10:18,880
Slash payment.

4214
05:10:18,880 --> 05:10:21,600
Dash intent.

4215
05:10:22,480 --> 05:10:26,960
The method should be a post and the body should be.

4216
05:10:26,960 --> 05:10:29,280
An amount.

4217
05:10:29,280 --> 05:10:35,840
We do not need any tags for this, so we're creating a stripe payment amount or payment

4218
05:10:35,840 --> 05:10:40,080
intent, sending the amount to the endpoint that we just created.

4219
05:10:40,080 --> 05:10:47,280
And then from here, we need to create an endpoint for this, so we're going to do use

4220
05:10:47,280 --> 05:10:50,880
crate stripe payment intent mutation.

4221
05:10:50,880 --> 05:10:54,000
So that should be sent to our back end.

4222
05:10:54,000 --> 05:11:00,720
All right, so we're going to close all of this and I'm going to open up and go to our

4223
05:11:00,720 --> 05:11:01,520
front end.

4224
05:11:01,520 --> 05:11:05,600
So now all of this is going to happen on the non dashboard page.

4225
05:11:05,600 --> 05:11:09,280
So here I'm just going to create a new folder and we're going to call this checkout.

4226
05:11:09,280 --> 05:11:12,960
Inside the checkout, we're going to create a new file.

4227
05:11:12,960 --> 05:11:15,440
We're going to call this page dot TSX.

4228
05:11:17,520 --> 05:11:24,160
I'm going to close this up, do RAF, CE, and this should be called checkout wizard.

4229
05:11:24,160 --> 05:11:33,040
Now we first need to check if the user is loaded, so we are going to grab is loaded

4230
05:11:33,040 --> 05:11:36,720
from use user from clerk next JS.

4231
05:11:36,720 --> 05:11:42,960
And we are obviously, of course, going to make sure it is loaded.

4232
05:11:42,960 --> 05:11:48,720
So if it isn't loaded, we are going to return the loading component that we've created,

4233
05:11:48,720 --> 05:11:50,400
which is very nice and convenient.

4234
05:11:50,400 --> 05:11:56,240
And we're going to create something called render step, which is a function.

4235
05:11:56,240 --> 05:12:01,520
And this is going to return and this is going to determine the step that we are on for the

4236
05:12:01,520 --> 05:12:02,080
checkout.

4237
05:12:02,080 --> 05:12:03,600
So there is three steps.

4238
05:12:03,600 --> 05:12:07,760
The first step we're going to call the checkout details page.

4239
05:12:07,760 --> 05:12:10,320
Second is going to be the payment page.

4240
05:12:10,320 --> 05:12:12,800
And the third is going to be the completion page.

4241
05:12:13,440 --> 05:12:18,240
So I'm going to use a switch statement, which is not often.

4242
05:12:18,240 --> 05:12:23,200
And we are going to have this variable called checkout step.

4243
05:12:23,200 --> 05:12:29,760
So this will determine what step we are on in terms of the pages that we have.

4244
05:12:29,760 --> 05:12:34,400
So we haven't identified yet, but for now, we're just going to do return.

4245
05:12:34,400 --> 05:12:39,920
We're going to say checkout details page, and we're going to fill out the rest of it.

4246
05:12:39,920 --> 05:12:47,920
Case two is going to be a return payment page like so.

4247
05:12:47,920 --> 05:12:55,840
And then case three is going to be return completion page.

4248
05:12:55,840 --> 05:13:03,920
And then we always need to set a default and the default is just going to be return checkout

4249
05:13:03,920 --> 05:13:06,160
details page.

4250
05:13:07,520 --> 05:13:13,360
So for now, we'll get back to how we identified the checkout step because it is a little bit

4251
05:13:13,360 --> 05:13:18,400
of a logic challenge that we need to handle.

4252
05:13:18,400 --> 05:13:21,280
But first, let's set up the JSX over here.

4253
05:13:21,280 --> 05:13:24,080
We're going to give this a class name of checkout.

4254
05:13:24,080 --> 05:13:33,360
And then we're going to pass in a div with class name checkout_content.

4255
05:13:34,960 --> 05:13:40,560
In here, we're going to have a render step, and that's going to be what we created before.

4256
05:13:40,560 --> 05:13:42,160
So that's going to be displayed.

4257
05:13:42,160 --> 05:13:44,880
But we also need the wizard stepper.

4258
05:13:44,880 --> 05:13:51,760
So if you take a look at the checkout page, we have this stepper component right here.

4259
05:13:51,760 --> 05:13:52,880
Let me open this up.

4260
05:13:52,880 --> 05:13:57,920
We have the stepper component with details, payment, and completion.

4261
05:13:57,920 --> 05:14:02,080
So we need the logic to handle that aspect.

4262
05:14:02,080 --> 05:14:05,520
Whereas the render step represents everything under it.

4263
05:14:05,520 --> 05:14:09,200
So this is going to be dependent on the page we are at.

4264
05:14:09,200 --> 05:14:15,520
So I'm going to create a component called wizard_stepper.

4265
05:14:15,520 --> 05:14:22,480
And we are going to pass in the current step, which is the checkout step, like so.

4266
05:14:22,480 --> 05:14:25,120
So let's create that.

4267
05:14:25,120 --> 05:14:30,560
So I'm going to go over here, go to our components directory, create a new file,

4268
05:14:31,280 --> 05:14:33,520
and call this wizard_stepper.tsx.

4269
05:14:33,520 --> 05:14:40,000
Inside here, I'm going to do r-a-f-c-e.

4270
05:14:40,000 --> 05:14:44,880
And inside here, we need to pass in the prop that we just added,

4271
05:14:44,880 --> 05:14:48,400
which is the current step, with wizard_stepper_props.

4272
05:14:48,400 --> 05:14:54,160
Now inside here, I'm going to have a class name.

4273
05:14:54,160 --> 05:14:54,960
Oops.

4274
05:14:54,960 --> 05:14:58,720
Class name of wizard-stepper.

4275
05:14:59,280 --> 05:15:04,000
Now I'm going to copy right here, so because we are going to use that class multiple times.

4276
05:15:04,000 --> 05:15:12,640
And then in here, I'm going to do colon div class name wizard_stepper_container.

4277
05:15:12,640 --> 05:15:20,080
And we're going to do 1, 2, and 3.

4278
05:15:20,080 --> 05:15:21,600
So we have three steps.

4279
05:15:21,600 --> 05:15:27,600
So we're going to map this out with a step, comma, index.

4280
05:15:28,480 --> 05:15:30,080
And we're going to do an arrow function.

4281
05:15:30,080 --> 05:15:34,960
And we're going to return a react.fragment.

4282
05:15:34,960 --> 05:15:40,880
We're using the text react fragment this time because we need to pass in a key.

4283
05:15:40,880 --> 05:15:46,640
You cannot pass in a key without the react.fragment directly.

4284
05:15:46,640 --> 05:15:49,680
So inside here, we're going to have a div.

4285
05:15:49,680 --> 05:15:51,840
We're going to have a class name.

4286
05:15:53,120 --> 05:16:02,000
But this time, this is going to be cn_wizard-stepper_circle.

4287
05:16:02,000 --> 05:16:05,840
Now make sure you spell that correctly.

4288
05:16:05,840 --> 05:16:08,160
I'm going to copy this because we're going to use this multiple times.

4289
05:16:08,160 --> 05:16:12,080
Actually, let's copy this right here.

4290
05:16:12,080 --> 05:16:15,680
And then we're going to do comma.

4291
05:16:15,680 --> 05:16:17,680
And we're going to have different conditions.

4292
05:16:17,680 --> 05:16:22,960
So the wizard_stepper is a little complicated when it comes to the display of the colors.

4293
05:16:23,120 --> 05:16:24,080
And things like that.

4294
05:16:24,080 --> 05:16:33,280
So if the circle is completed, we are going to have a logic based on the current step.

4295
05:16:33,280 --> 05:16:40,560
If the current step is greater than the current step that we are at.

4296
05:16:40,560 --> 05:16:46,560
So if the current step is like one, or the current step is two,

4297
05:16:46,560 --> 05:16:50,320
but the step that we're talking about is the first step.

4298
05:16:51,280 --> 05:16:53,520
That's what we're talking about here for that condition.

4299
05:16:53,520 --> 05:17:04,640
If that's true, or if current step is equal to the last one, and step is equal to three,

4300
05:17:04,640 --> 05:17:07,920
we're going to use the completed CSS.

4301
05:17:07,920 --> 05:17:10,640
So this is when it becomes like a checkmark.

4302
05:17:10,640 --> 05:17:15,840
So if we're at step three, it's going to become a checkmark like this.

4303
05:17:17,120 --> 05:17:22,080
Over here, we're going to do wizard_stepper, circle for current.

4304
05:17:22,080 --> 05:17:28,640
So if it is the current one, which is current step is equal to step.

4305
05:17:28,640 --> 05:17:38,800
But if it's not equal to the final step, this is going to be what we are going to use.

4306
05:17:38,800 --> 05:17:44,640
So current represents a situation where it's going to be purple like this.

4307
05:17:44,640 --> 05:17:45,760
This is the purple color.

4308
05:17:46,640 --> 05:17:52,400
And for final condition is going to be the circle when it's upcoming.

4309
05:17:52,400 --> 05:17:57,360
So that means we are not at that step yet.

4310
05:17:57,360 --> 05:17:58,800
So that one's pretty simple.

4311
05:17:58,800 --> 05:18:02,320
Current step is less than the actual step we are at.

4312
05:18:02,320 --> 05:18:10,080
So we have these three different conditions for the different classes.

4313
05:18:10,080 --> 05:18:12,000
Whereas this is just like the base class.

4314
05:18:12,640 --> 05:18:16,880
We're going to add these different classes depending on what step we are.

4315
05:18:16,880 --> 05:18:24,160
A little confusing, but we had a lot of different conditions for each color.

4316
05:18:24,160 --> 05:18:30,960
And then in here, we're also going to have a situation where we check current step.

4317
05:18:30,960 --> 05:18:37,920
If it's greater than step, we are also going to do current step like this.

4318
05:18:37,920 --> 05:18:43,360
So basically, we're just going to copy this over here, paste it over here.

4319
05:18:43,360 --> 05:18:51,440
We're going to do question mark, pass in a check component from BlueSide React, which is an icon.

4320
05:18:51,440 --> 05:18:54,560
So class name is going to be width five, height five.

4321
05:18:54,560 --> 05:18:56,720
So we have a check mark when it's completed.

4322
05:18:56,720 --> 05:19:02,160
Otherwise, we're going to do a colon like so.

4323
05:19:04,960 --> 05:19:09,840
We're going to pass in span and then we're obviously going to pass in the step,

4324
05:19:09,840 --> 05:19:11,760
which is just a number.

4325
05:19:11,760 --> 05:19:16,320
And that's going to show the little check mark or basically a number.

4326
05:19:16,320 --> 05:19:19,600
Below this, we're going to have a p tag.

4327
05:19:19,600 --> 05:19:25,120
And this is going to be class name with CN once again.

4328
05:19:25,120 --> 05:19:34,320
And we're going to do wizard dash stepper underscore text comma and curly braces.

4329
05:19:35,520 --> 05:19:38,400
We're going to copy the wizard dash stepper once again.

4330
05:19:38,400 --> 05:19:44,800
Underscore text if it's active.

4331
05:19:44,800 --> 05:19:47,520
So now we're handling the text part of it.

4332
05:19:47,520 --> 05:19:49,840
The text color also needs to change.

4333
05:19:49,840 --> 05:19:56,400
So if it is current step is greater than or equal to step, we're going to give that active class.

4334
05:19:56,960 --> 05:20:07,200
Otherwise, we are going to do text dash dash inactive class if current step is less than step.

4335
05:20:07,200 --> 05:20:11,440
For the text, it's not as complicated because we don't need to do as many things.

4336
05:20:11,440 --> 05:20:16,880
And we also need to make sure we close this p tag.

4337
05:20:16,880 --> 05:20:20,320
And then we're going to have step if that's equal to one.

4338
05:20:20,320 --> 05:20:25,120
We're going to have details.

4339
05:20:26,000 --> 05:20:27,840
Just copy this two more times.

4340
05:20:27,840 --> 05:20:33,200
Change this to two changes to three.

4341
05:20:33,200 --> 05:20:36,400
This should be payment.

4342
05:20:36,400 --> 05:20:39,120
And this should be completion.

4343
05:20:39,120 --> 05:20:46,640
And we also need to add a div around like right below the react fragment.

4344
05:20:46,640 --> 05:20:49,840
We're going to do class name is equal to wizard stepper.

4345
05:20:53,040 --> 05:20:56,080
Underscore underscore step like this.

4346
05:20:56,080 --> 05:21:02,560
And we need to make sure we close that around the p tag over here.

4347
05:21:02,560 --> 05:21:06,800
And then finally, we have this line.

4348
05:21:06,800 --> 05:21:09,920
We need to make sure if it's completed, it's going to be green.

4349
05:21:09,920 --> 05:21:15,280
We're just going to do if index is less than two.

4350
05:21:15,280 --> 05:21:18,480
We're going to have a div.

4351
05:21:20,400 --> 05:21:30,800
And we're going to give it class name of cn wizard dash stepper.

4352
05:21:30,800 --> 05:21:33,520
Actually, you know what?

4353
05:21:33,520 --> 05:21:38,800
Let's just copy this entire thing that we had before because it's pretty similar to this one.

4354
05:21:38,800 --> 05:21:43,680
We're going to change the text to be line for all of these.

4355
05:21:43,680 --> 05:21:46,400
Then change this to completed.

4356
05:21:47,600 --> 05:21:51,520
And then this one should be incomplete.

4357
05:21:51,520 --> 05:21:56,080
And we're just going to reverse this current step should be greater.

4358
05:21:56,080 --> 05:21:58,560
And this one should be less than or equal to.

4359
05:21:58,560 --> 05:22:04,640
And then make sure we do a self-closing tag of the div.

4360
05:22:04,640 --> 05:22:07,680
So this determines the line for our stepper.

4361
05:22:07,680 --> 05:22:10,400
And so we have our stepper component.

4362
05:22:11,440 --> 05:22:17,200
We need to make sure we import it for our checkout wizard page.

4363
05:22:17,200 --> 05:22:23,200
And now we can start handling the checkout step logic.

4364
05:22:23,200 --> 05:22:31,600
So this will be determining the routing and the navigation for these three pages.

4365
05:22:31,600 --> 05:22:37,120
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a separate hook for this to keep it nice and clean.

4366
05:22:38,960 --> 05:22:40,320
So I'm going to go over here.

4367
05:22:40,320 --> 05:22:43,440
I'm going to say const checkout step.

4368
05:22:43,440 --> 05:22:47,760
And we are going to do use checkout navigation.

4369
05:22:47,760 --> 05:22:54,720
And this will be a hook that we create in our hooks folder.

4370
05:22:54,720 --> 05:22:59,040
And we're going to call this use checkout navigation dot ts.

4371
05:22:59,040 --> 05:23:01,120
All right.

4372
05:23:01,120 --> 05:23:03,360
So in here, we're going to do rafce.

4373
05:23:03,360 --> 05:23:06,560
We're going to have use checkout navigation.

4374
05:23:08,320 --> 05:23:11,520
And in this case, we're just going to change this to export const

4375
05:23:11,520 --> 05:23:15,200
use checkout navigation instead of using default.

4376
05:23:15,200 --> 05:23:20,720
Now, this is not a TypeScript component or it's not a React component.

4377
05:23:20,720 --> 05:23:22,080
So we're just going to remove the return.

4378
05:23:22,080 --> 05:23:24,560
We're going to do router.

4379
05:23:24,560 --> 05:23:26,800
And we're going to use navigation.

4380
05:23:26,800 --> 05:23:31,120
So basically use router from next slash navigation.

4381
05:23:31,120 --> 05:23:34,880
And then we're also going to grab the search params,

4382
05:23:36,160 --> 05:23:38,480
which is use search params.

4383
05:23:38,480 --> 05:23:46,080
And we are going to do const is loaded and is signed in.

4384
05:23:46,080 --> 05:23:50,960
And we're all going to grab this from use user from clerk next JS.

4385
05:23:50,960 --> 05:23:52,880
And we're going to invoke that as well.

4386
05:23:52,880 --> 05:23:58,880
And use search params should also come from next navigation.

4387
05:23:58,880 --> 05:24:04,720
So what I want to show you is the URL that we're using for the checkout pages.

4388
05:24:04,720 --> 05:24:08,320
So it's going to look like this checkout slash.

4389
05:24:08,320 --> 05:24:09,680
You don't have to write this.

4390
05:24:09,680 --> 05:24:14,000
We're going to have slash checkout, which and then the step that we are on

4391
05:24:14,000 --> 05:24:18,720
the course ID that we're using and whether we should show sign up.

4392
05:24:18,720 --> 05:24:22,560
Now, this show sign up is going to be representative

4393
05:24:22,560 --> 05:24:25,040
for this particular page right here.

4394
05:24:25,040 --> 05:24:28,800
So if you take a look, let me move this up.

4395
05:24:28,800 --> 05:24:32,320
If you take a look, this right here is the sign up page.

4396
05:24:32,320 --> 05:24:34,640
But then we also have the sign in component.

4397
05:24:34,640 --> 05:24:38,720
So if they already have an account, they can hit sign in,

4398
05:24:38,720 --> 05:24:43,120
but we don't want them to be navigated to the sign in sign up pages that we're

4399
05:24:43,120 --> 05:24:45,840
at earlier that we already created.

4400
05:24:45,840 --> 05:24:48,560
We want to keep them on this particular page.

4401
05:24:48,560 --> 05:24:52,240
So that sign up component becomes the sign in component.

4402
05:24:52,240 --> 05:24:57,200
And we keep that state in the URL via this show sign up.

4403
05:24:57,200 --> 05:25:01,120
Meaning true, that means we are on this page.

4404
05:25:01,120 --> 05:25:03,680
If it's false, we are on the sign in component.

4405
05:25:03,680 --> 05:25:07,280
And this is only applicable for step one, basically.

4406
05:25:07,280 --> 05:25:10,960
And then we also didn't mean to do that.

4407
05:25:10,960 --> 05:25:13,680
We also need to show the course ID as well.

4408
05:25:13,680 --> 05:25:16,720
So that determines what course they want to purchase.

4409
05:25:16,720 --> 05:25:18,960
So that's going to be held in the URL.

4410
05:25:18,960 --> 05:25:24,720
So with that, let's get started on figuring out this code.

4411
05:25:24,720 --> 05:25:30,320
So we're going to find the course ID via the search params.

4412
05:25:30,320 --> 05:25:33,360
So we're grabbing the ID from the URL.

4413
05:25:33,360 --> 05:25:38,000
And we're going to make sure it's at least double question mark

4414
05:25:38,000 --> 05:25:42,640
and instantiated with string to make sure we don't have any TypeScript errors

4415
05:25:42,640 --> 05:25:45,120
and make sure it is identified.

4416
05:25:45,120 --> 05:25:46,720
And then we also have checkout step.

4417
05:25:46,720 --> 05:25:51,520
Now, checkout step is when we grab it from the URL,

4418
05:25:51,520 --> 05:25:57,680
it's going to be a string, but we need the number version of this to use in our code.

4419
05:25:57,680 --> 05:26:01,120
So search params dot get, we're going to grab the step.

4420
05:26:01,120 --> 05:26:06,240
And we're going to instantiate to default to be one.

4421
05:26:06,240 --> 05:26:07,680
That's like the default.

4422
05:26:07,680 --> 05:26:10,000
And we're going to make sure this is a number.

4423
05:26:10,000 --> 05:26:13,280
So we have the checkout step number.

4424
05:26:13,280 --> 05:26:16,400
And we also need to do use effect.

4425
05:26:16,400 --> 05:26:21,520
We're going to make sure if the user is loaded

4426
05:26:22,720 --> 05:26:31,520
and if they are not signed in, and if the checkout step is greater than one,

4427
05:26:31,520 --> 05:26:36,720
we're going to do navigate to step one.

4428
05:26:36,720 --> 05:26:39,680
So this is basically a check.

4429
05:26:39,680 --> 05:26:44,800
Remember, we don't want them to hit this page, like the payment details page,

4430
05:26:44,800 --> 05:26:46,080
if they're not signed in.

4431
05:26:46,080 --> 05:26:50,800
If they try to hit completed, we also want to redirect them to this particular page.

4432
05:26:50,800 --> 05:26:52,640
That's what we're doing right here.

4433
05:26:52,640 --> 05:26:57,600
And what we need is to create that function, navigate to step.

4434
05:26:57,600 --> 05:27:03,600
And we're going to use a use callback from React to make sure this works.

4435
05:27:03,600 --> 05:27:06,480
And then we have step with a number.

4436
05:27:06,480 --> 05:27:08,320
We're going to do an arrow function.

4437
05:27:08,320 --> 05:27:13,760
And we're going to pass in new step, a math dot min.

4438
05:27:13,760 --> 05:27:19,600
So math dot max of one comma step comma three.

4439
05:27:20,880 --> 05:27:26,000
So we're just going to determine if the step is between one and three, essentially.

4440
05:27:26,000 --> 05:27:30,400
And we want to take the number that is lower than three.

4441
05:27:30,400 --> 05:27:36,000
We want to make sure we grab the step value if it's greater than two or three.

4442
05:27:36,000 --> 05:27:37,920
That's essentially what this is doing right here.

4443
05:27:37,920 --> 05:27:43,200
And making sure that it's never above three as well.

4444
05:27:43,200 --> 05:27:46,880
So this is kind of a weird way to do it, but it makes it easier.

4445
05:27:47,600 --> 05:27:50,720
And then from here, we're going to do show sign up.

4446
05:27:50,720 --> 05:27:59,760
And we're going to say if the user is signed in, we are going to put true for the string.

4447
05:27:59,760 --> 05:28:01,600
Otherwise, we are going to say false.

4448
05:28:01,600 --> 05:28:03,840
And it needs to be in string form.

4449
05:28:03,840 --> 05:28:09,040
So we do that using router dot push.

4450
05:28:09,040 --> 05:28:13,040
And we are now going to be able to grab this URL,

4451
05:28:14,080 --> 05:28:21,840
push all those values that we've created into the URL, and we can navigate there.

4452
05:28:21,840 --> 05:28:29,520
And then finally, what we need to do for use callback is pass in all the values that may change.

4453
05:28:29,520 --> 05:28:32,400
And we're going to pass in router like so.

4454
05:28:32,400 --> 05:28:34,560
And we do have an error with the semicolon.

4455
05:28:34,560 --> 05:28:36,720
So make sure you have that.

4456
05:28:36,720 --> 05:28:42,800
And use effect needs to be imported from React.

4457
05:28:42,800 --> 05:28:53,120
And we also need to make sure that it is correctly having the correct dependencies for redirecting.

4458
05:28:53,120 --> 05:28:58,160
So is signed in, checkout step, we're going to have navigate to step as well.

4459
05:28:58,160 --> 05:29:01,920
So this part is for making sure the user is signed in.

4460
05:29:01,920 --> 05:29:07,840
This part is the function that allows us to navigate to a specific step.

4461
05:29:07,840 --> 05:29:09,440
This is the functionality for that.

4462
05:29:10,720 --> 05:29:15,520
And whereas checkout step is the value that we grab from the URL,

4463
05:29:15,520 --> 05:29:17,920
and that is the current step we are at.

4464
05:29:17,920 --> 05:29:22,320
So this one hook is doing all of the navigation for our checkout.

4465
05:29:22,320 --> 05:29:28,000
And all we want to do is we're going to return the checkout step and the navigate to step function.

4466
05:29:28,000 --> 05:29:33,920
So this does basically everything we need in terms of navigation for the checkout page,

4467
05:29:33,920 --> 05:29:35,600
which is quite complicated.

4468
05:29:37,120 --> 05:29:41,120
And then we're going to make sure we import that.

4469
05:29:41,120 --> 05:29:47,280
All right, so from here, now we can lay out the specific steps of these particular pages.

4470
05:29:47,280 --> 05:29:52,480
So the first thing we're going to do is create the checkout details page.

4471
05:29:52,480 --> 05:29:56,080
Like so we're going to create a component for this.

4472
05:29:56,080 --> 05:29:59,840
So we're going to go back to our directory.

4473
05:29:59,840 --> 05:30:04,960
Inside our checkout, I'm going to create a component called checkout.

4474
05:30:04,960 --> 05:30:08,160
I'm going to create a component called details.

4475
05:30:08,160 --> 05:30:13,600
And this time, I'm just going to call this indexed.tsx.

4476
05:30:13,600 --> 05:30:16,400
We're not going to create a separate, you know, page.tsx.

4477
05:30:16,400 --> 05:30:18,000
This should be index.

4478
05:30:18,000 --> 05:30:21,120
We're going to do rafce.

4479
05:30:21,120 --> 05:30:23,520
I'm going to call this checkout details page.

4480
05:30:23,520 --> 05:30:29,360
Now inside here, I'm going to grab the search params

4481
05:30:29,360 --> 05:30:33,920
because we are going to try and grab the current course that we have selected.

4482
05:30:33,920 --> 05:30:36,880
So we're going to use use search params.

4483
05:30:36,880 --> 05:30:43,120
We're going to grab course ID, search params.get ID.

4484
05:30:43,120 --> 05:30:49,600
And if it doesn't exist, we just want to make sure we grab that edge case.

4485
05:30:49,600 --> 05:30:53,680
And we also want to grab the data of the course.

4486
05:30:53,680 --> 05:30:56,240
Like so.

4487
05:30:56,240 --> 05:30:59,360
And we are going to do use get course query.

4488
05:31:00,240 --> 05:31:05,520
We also need to pass in course ID into this particular hook.

4489
05:31:05,520 --> 05:31:10,880
Now this is going to be reused in another page.

4490
05:31:10,880 --> 05:31:13,840
And it's kind of a hassle to rewrite all of this.

4491
05:31:13,840 --> 05:31:16,880
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up,

4492
05:31:16,880 --> 05:31:20,400
go to hooks component or hooks folder.

4493
05:31:20,400 --> 05:31:22,000
We're going to create a new file.

4494
05:31:22,000 --> 05:31:25,360
And we're just going to do use current course like so.

4495
05:31:25,360 --> 05:31:27,680
And we're going to do .ts.

4496
05:31:28,640 --> 05:31:37,360
And we are going to export const use current course like so.

4497
05:31:37,360 --> 05:31:38,560
We have an arrow function.

4498
05:31:38,560 --> 05:31:41,680
And we're going to paste in what we just wrote.

4499
05:31:41,680 --> 05:31:43,840
Make sure we import that.

4500
05:31:43,840 --> 05:31:48,000
Make sure we import this one.

4501
05:31:48,000 --> 05:31:51,440
And we're just going to do .rest.

4502
05:31:51,440 --> 05:31:55,520
So we can just grab everything that we need for the get course query.

4503
05:31:55,520 --> 05:31:57,760
If we need it, we're going to do return.

4504
05:31:57,760 --> 05:32:03,760
We're going to grab course course ID dot dot dot rest.

4505
05:32:03,760 --> 05:32:09,120
So this is just an easy way for us to grab the current course in multiple different files.

4506
05:32:09,120 --> 05:32:13,760
So if I were to go back to our checkout details page,

4507
05:32:13,760 --> 05:32:20,880
instead of having this, we can instead use use current course from the hooks.

4508
05:32:22,800 --> 05:32:29,360
And we can grab const course, which is the selected course that we have selected.

4509
05:32:29,360 --> 05:32:36,000
We're going to pass in is loading because that comes from the dot dot dot rest that we created.

4510
05:32:36,000 --> 05:32:40,800
And we're able to grab it all in one go with just use current course.

4511
05:32:40,800 --> 05:32:45,440
And we're doing this because we are using this in another file.

4512
05:32:45,440 --> 05:32:48,240
So we're going to do search params one more time.

4513
05:32:48,800 --> 05:32:55,600
And this time we're doing this because we're not incorporating it in the use current course

4514
05:32:55,600 --> 05:33:03,200
because this is just going to be used one time, which is for a const show sign up.

4515
05:33:03,200 --> 05:33:08,560
And this will determine whether we show the sign in component or the sign up component.

4516
05:33:08,560 --> 05:33:15,920
We're going to show sign up and this is going to be true like so.

4517
05:33:17,120 --> 05:33:22,080
And before we write out the elements we are going to do is loading.

4518
05:33:22,080 --> 05:33:26,000
Make sure we do return loading component.

4519
05:33:26,000 --> 05:33:39,440
Should return that if is error, we are going to return div failed to fetch course data.

4520
05:33:40,880 --> 05:33:51,120
And then if selected course is not returned, we are going to say return div course not found.

4521
05:33:51,120 --> 05:33:54,000
Sure, there's no space.

4522
05:33:54,000 --> 05:33:59,520
And now let's actually run up our server, make sure everything is working.

4523
05:33:59,520 --> 05:34:04,720
We're going to make sure we import checkout details page while we run our server.

4524
05:34:04,720 --> 05:34:10,480
We're going to go back, save this, and we are going to refresh.

4525
05:34:11,280 --> 05:34:17,600
And we're going to hit select or search courses, which will take us to this particular page.

4526
05:34:17,600 --> 05:34:21,200
And what we want to do is click on a role now.

4527
05:34:21,200 --> 05:34:26,000
And so once again, we need a use client directory.

4528
05:34:26,000 --> 05:34:31,040
And that's going to happen on the checkout details page right here.

4529
05:34:31,040 --> 05:34:36,320
So we're going to do use client and I'm going to get rid of this because we don't need that.

4530
05:34:38,080 --> 05:34:42,960
Save it. And we're going to go back, open up use checkout navigation,

4531
05:34:42,960 --> 05:34:45,600
because we need use client anytime.

4532
05:34:45,600 --> 05:34:53,360
We are using search param. And we're going to do this one by one.

4533
05:34:53,360 --> 05:34:58,800
We're going to go to checkout wizard because we're also using their use client as well.

4534
05:34:58,800 --> 05:35:05,040
And here, perfect. We have what we are seeing in here.

4535
05:35:05,040 --> 05:35:09,200
We see the checkout details page. So we see this.

4536
05:35:09,200 --> 05:35:15,120
So technically, when we're signed in, we should be redirected to payment page on step two,

4537
05:35:15,120 --> 05:35:18,080
but that's only when we have the component.

4538
05:35:18,080 --> 05:35:24,080
So when we create this sign in component, we are going to have this redirect URL.

4539
05:35:24,080 --> 05:35:29,920
That's going to take us to step two of the page if we are on this particular one.

4540
05:35:29,920 --> 05:35:34,960
So let's start by filling out our checkout details page code.

4541
05:35:34,960 --> 05:35:41,280
So inside here, I'm going to have a class name. I'm going to pass in checkout dash details.

4542
05:35:41,280 --> 05:35:46,320
Get rid of that. And then we're going to have another div.

4543
05:35:46,320 --> 05:35:54,000
We're going to do class name of checkout dash details underscore container.

4544
05:35:56,640 --> 05:36:01,520
I'm going to copy this right here so we don't have to rewrite it every single time.

4545
05:36:01,520 --> 05:36:05,600
So we're going to do div, paste that with preview.

4546
05:36:05,600 --> 05:36:10,800
And we are going to pass in the course preview we created a long time ago.

4547
05:36:10,800 --> 05:36:14,800
So course preview. Actually, sorry, we didn't create the course preview.

4548
05:36:14,800 --> 05:36:18,880
We created the accordion, but the course preview will have the accordion.

4549
05:36:18,880 --> 05:36:26,160
I think that's what I meant to say. So course, we are going to pass in selected course.

4550
05:36:27,200 --> 05:36:30,960
Now we're going to close this and we are going to create our course preview.

4551
05:36:30,960 --> 05:36:36,400
So I'm going to go over here. I'm going to open this up in the components,

4552
05:36:36,400 --> 05:36:43,440
create a new file, and we're going to call this course preview that TSX.

4553
05:36:43,440 --> 05:36:51,200
And call this RAFCE. And we are going to pass in the course that we did

4554
05:36:51,920 --> 05:36:58,880
and have it course preview props like so. And we are going to grab the price.

4555
05:36:58,880 --> 05:37:02,800
We're going to say format price, which is from Utils.

4556
05:37:02,800 --> 05:37:04,720
So we're going to have course dot price like so.

4557
05:37:04,720 --> 05:37:09,760
And we're going to be using that to create our course preview.

4558
05:37:09,760 --> 05:37:17,600
So this is pretty straightforward. We're going to have class name with course dash preview.

4559
05:37:18,160 --> 05:37:21,840
Once again, we're going to copy the class name and that value.

4560
05:37:21,840 --> 05:37:30,720
So we're going to have div class name course preview underscore container.

4561
05:37:30,720 --> 05:37:36,000
And then another div with class name course preview.

4562
05:37:36,000 --> 05:37:38,000
This is going to be the image wrapper.

4563
05:37:38,000 --> 05:37:47,760
And inside here, we're going to have an image from next image component.

4564
05:37:48,560 --> 05:37:52,240
We're going to do source is equal to course dot image.

4565
05:37:52,240 --> 05:37:58,400
And we're going to make sure we have some kind of placeholder.

4566
05:37:58,400 --> 05:38:04,720
We don't have a preview placeholder image. You can add that if you would like.

4567
05:38:04,720 --> 05:38:12,400
We're going to have a course preview as well. The width is going to be 640.

4568
05:38:14,000 --> 05:38:22,800
Height is going to be 360. Class name is going to be width of full.

4569
05:38:22,800 --> 05:38:26,240
We're going to make sure we close the image tag.

4570
05:38:26,240 --> 05:38:32,480
So. Get rid of the course preview text.

4571
05:38:32,480 --> 05:38:36,880
And right below the first closing div, we're going to have another div.

4572
05:38:36,880 --> 05:38:43,440
Set this to be H2 class name course preview underscore title.

4573
05:38:44,640 --> 05:38:48,480
Close that out with course dot title like so.

4574
05:38:48,480 --> 05:38:53,040
Go to the next line. We're going to do P tag with class name.

4575
05:38:53,040 --> 05:38:56,560
Actually, this time we don't need the course preview.

4576
05:38:56,560 --> 05:39:02,320
We can just do text gray 400 text MD margin bottom of four.

4577
05:39:02,320 --> 05:39:08,000
And we can say by course that teacher name.

4578
05:39:10,640 --> 05:39:16,960
Below this, we're going to have a P with class name is equal to text, small text,

4579
05:39:16,960 --> 05:39:22,400
custom graze, dirty. Gray like so.

4580
05:39:22,400 --> 05:39:24,960
As you can see, there's a lot of styling to it,

4581
05:39:24,960 --> 05:39:27,520
and that's why I'm using all these tailoring classes,

4582
05:39:27,520 --> 05:39:32,000
because it is quite the hassle to write all of them, because some of these classes,

4583
05:39:32,000 --> 05:39:34,400
well, some of them might be short like this one.

4584
05:39:34,400 --> 05:39:38,560
There are other ones that are super, super long in terms of the amount of classes that you need.

4585
05:39:39,680 --> 05:39:42,560
And I don't know how instructional that is.

4586
05:39:42,560 --> 05:39:46,160
That's why I created all these classes for those.

4587
05:39:46,160 --> 05:39:56,240
Below this, I have H4 tag. We are going to pass in class name once again, text white 50.

4588
05:39:56,240 --> 05:39:59,840
And if you wanted, you can do an opacity of 90.

4589
05:39:59,840 --> 05:40:02,880
So that's how you would do it with tail one.

4590
05:40:02,880 --> 05:40:06,880
We're also going to have font semi bold margin bottom of two.

4591
05:40:07,600 --> 05:40:11,840
Pass that in, call this course content, save it.

4592
05:40:11,840 --> 05:40:18,400
And then on this next particular line, we are going to do accordion sections.

4593
05:40:18,400 --> 05:40:24,320
And we're going to pass that in from the accordion sections that we created

4594
05:40:24,320 --> 05:40:26,800
a long time ago from the search page.

4595
05:40:26,800 --> 05:40:31,520
We're going to pass in course dot sections like so.

4596
05:40:31,520 --> 05:40:34,320
And we're almost done with this page.

4597
05:40:34,320 --> 05:40:39,760
So below the two closing divs, we're going to have another div right here.

4598
05:40:39,760 --> 05:40:45,680
And we're going to paste course preview underscore container.

4599
05:40:45,680 --> 05:40:56,960
Inside here, we are going to have an H3 class name of text, Excel margin bottom of four.

4600
05:40:56,960 --> 05:41:01,120
We're going to do price details of one item.

4601
05:41:01,120 --> 05:41:03,840
You can only buy one item at a time.

4602
05:41:03,840 --> 05:41:05,440
I did not add the functionality.

4603
05:41:05,440 --> 05:41:06,320
It's up to you.

4604
05:41:06,320 --> 05:41:09,360
If you want to make that a stretch goal, we could add this.

4605
05:41:09,360 --> 05:41:18,720
And it seems like this page, I particularly didn't create enough classes for all of these.

4606
05:41:18,720 --> 05:41:20,000
Don't know why.

4607
05:41:20,000 --> 05:41:27,680
But anyways, custom grays, dirty gray text base like so.

4608
05:41:29,040 --> 05:41:37,920
And inside here, I'm going to do a span with class name of font dash bold with string.

4609
05:41:37,920 --> 05:41:41,760
I'm going to do one X course title.

4610
05:41:41,760 --> 05:41:47,360
And I'm going to copy this, paste it over here.

4611
05:41:47,360 --> 05:41:52,480
I'm going to copy this entire thing, paste it over here like that.

4612
05:41:53,520 --> 05:42:00,400
Instead, this is going to be border T like that.

4613
05:42:00,400 --> 05:42:07,360
This is going to be border custom grays, dirty gray.

4614
05:42:07,360 --> 05:42:16,800
And this is going to be padding top of four font bold course title.

4615
05:42:16,800 --> 05:42:19,280
This should be a price.

4616
05:42:22,240 --> 05:42:30,160
Right here with the font bold, this should be total amount and the text should be large.

4617
05:42:30,160 --> 05:42:33,680
This should also be text large as well.

4618
05:42:33,680 --> 05:42:38,160
And we are going to put price as well over here.

4619
05:42:38,160 --> 05:42:45,920
We're going to save that and we're going to go back over here into our checkout details page.

4620
05:42:48,320 --> 05:42:51,120
Finally, import the course preview.

4621
05:42:51,120 --> 05:42:54,720
Refresh the page.

4622
05:42:54,720 --> 05:42:59,840
And now we should see the course preview on the left side.

4623
05:42:59,840 --> 05:43:03,760
Now, the other part is this guest checkout.

4624
05:43:03,760 --> 05:43:07,280
I don't normally do this, but I'm just going to copy and paste it.

4625
05:43:07,280 --> 05:43:12,640
You can pause it if you want to add it, but the functionality for this is not really there.

4626
05:43:12,640 --> 05:43:17,680
So I'm just adding it to show you this would be best practice on a checkout system.

4627
05:43:17,680 --> 05:43:25,120
It was just the scope became so out of control for this application that I just added this.

4628
05:43:25,120 --> 05:43:28,480
But I did not.

4629
05:43:28,480 --> 05:43:30,720
I'm not going to go through all of it.

4630
05:43:30,720 --> 05:43:33,920
Make sure we import all of this.

4631
05:43:33,920 --> 05:43:42,640
And right here below this closing div, I'm just going to call this stretch feature like so.

4632
05:43:43,600 --> 05:43:50,160
And I'm going to make sure we import from React hook form.

4633
05:43:50,160 --> 05:43:53,440
We're going to import custom form field.

4634
05:43:53,440 --> 05:43:57,760
We're also going to import button as well.

4635
05:43:57,760 --> 05:44:04,640
And I believe we are missing a closing div as well.

4636
05:44:04,640 --> 05:44:09,040
Oh, you got to be careful like I wasn't.

4637
05:44:09,040 --> 05:44:18,800
So import form from at components at slash components slash UI slash form.

4638
05:44:18,800 --> 05:44:23,600
So you want to import it from Shad CN, not react hook form because those are different.

4639
05:44:23,600 --> 05:44:28,080
So we'll have the guest checkout just like that.

4640
05:44:28,080 --> 05:44:29,440
Pretty simple.

4641
05:44:29,440 --> 05:44:36,320
Typically, you would have to save this information in your state and then use that later.

4642
05:44:36,320 --> 05:44:37,600
And then you would create a transaction.

4643
05:44:37,600 --> 05:44:40,400
But I didn't want to do that because it's just too much already.

4644
05:44:40,400 --> 05:44:44,640
And then after that, I'm just going to paste this.

4645
05:44:44,640 --> 05:44:47,440
This is only if you have the checkout.

4646
05:44:47,440 --> 05:44:50,320
You can pause it and just write this if you would like.

4647
05:44:50,320 --> 05:44:52,960
That gives us an or option.

4648
05:44:52,960 --> 05:44:57,600
And then below this, this is where we can actually put class name.

4649
05:44:57,600 --> 05:45:02,400
Checkout dash details underscore off.

4650
05:45:02,400 --> 05:45:04,400
Close this out.

4651
05:45:04,400 --> 05:45:12,960
We can do show sign up and we can pass in sign up component from not.

4652
05:45:12,960 --> 05:45:20,080
Let's redo this sign up should be coming from the sign up component that we created.

4653
05:45:20,080 --> 05:45:26,960
Not not the sign up component from directly from next clerk, basically.

4654
05:45:26,960 --> 05:45:29,680
But we want to do it from the one that we created.

4655
05:45:29,680 --> 05:45:32,800
So sign in component.

4656
05:45:32,800 --> 05:45:37,280
And we're going to do just like that.

4657
05:45:37,280 --> 05:45:38,880
So there you go.

4658
05:45:38,880 --> 05:45:44,320
With this, it's going to automatically redirect us on to checkout step two page.

4659
05:45:44,320 --> 05:45:49,040
And the reason why that's happening is because we have the component redirecting it if we're

4660
05:45:49,040 --> 05:45:49,840
signed in.

4661
05:45:49,840 --> 05:45:51,360
So if I go to step one.

4662
05:45:52,720 --> 05:45:59,760
So if we did, if you wrote step one, it should technically take us to step two of this page.

4663
05:45:59,760 --> 05:46:02,000
And by the way, I did make a mistake over here.

4664
05:46:02,000 --> 05:46:10,320
If you go to the sign in component, we actually need to set this to be and sign up to be true

4665
05:46:10,320 --> 05:46:12,640
for sign in.

4666
05:46:12,640 --> 05:46:17,280
Actually, this should be false or true, just like that.

4667
05:46:18,000 --> 05:46:25,920
And then over here for sign up, this should be and sign up should be false like this.

4668
05:46:25,920 --> 05:46:32,960
So the reason why we do this is so that we know if we go to directly to step one, but

4669
05:46:32,960 --> 05:46:33,840
we're signed in.

4670
05:46:33,840 --> 05:46:37,280
It's going to take us to the correct page.

4671
05:46:37,280 --> 05:46:38,880
Let's say enroll now.

4672
05:46:38,880 --> 05:46:41,840
It's not going to take us to the details page as we expect.

4673
05:46:41,840 --> 05:46:42,880
So this is perfect.

4674
05:46:44,080 --> 05:46:45,920
So let's say we sign out.

4675
05:46:45,920 --> 05:46:50,560
And we try to enroll in this specific course.

4676
05:46:50,560 --> 05:46:55,440
We try to enroll now, we would go to this particular page.

4677
05:46:55,440 --> 05:47:02,240
And if we tried to go directly to step two in the URL, it's going to redirect us to this

4678
05:47:02,240 --> 05:47:03,680
page because we need to sign in.

4679
05:47:03,680 --> 05:47:07,360
This is exactly how we wanted to do.

4680
05:47:07,360 --> 05:47:08,720
So let's say we signed in.

4681
05:47:13,200 --> 05:47:16,160
We are going to be taken to the payment page.

4682
05:47:16,160 --> 05:47:18,880
Let's try signing in one more time.

4683
05:47:18,880 --> 05:47:21,040
I want to show you one more thing.

4684
05:47:21,040 --> 05:47:26,320
If I hit sign up, it's going to take you to the sign up the same page with the sign up

4685
05:47:26,320 --> 05:47:26,880
component.

4686
05:47:26,880 --> 05:47:32,000
So it's a nice way to show our checkout flow.

4687
05:47:32,000 --> 05:47:33,440
So I'm just going to log in.

4688
05:47:33,440 --> 05:47:39,760
So take us to the payment page, which we'll work on next.

4689
05:47:39,760 --> 05:47:41,760
So I'm going to close all of this.

4690
05:47:42,720 --> 05:47:48,240
So from here, I'm going to go back to our checkout wizard and we're going to go over

4691
05:47:48,240 --> 05:47:48,560
here.

4692
05:47:48,560 --> 05:47:52,000
I'm going to call this payment page like so.

4693
05:47:52,000 --> 05:47:59,440
And inside our directory for checkout, I'm going to create another folder.

4694
05:47:59,440 --> 05:48:04,240
I'm going to call this payment and I'm going to create a file called index.tsx.

4695
05:48:08,560 --> 05:48:13,280
Call this RAFCE payment page content.

4696
05:48:13,280 --> 05:48:16,000
We're going to give it as content as well.

4697
05:48:16,000 --> 05:48:18,560
And then over here, I'm going to create another file.

4698
05:48:18,560 --> 05:48:21,360
I'm going to call this stripe provider.

4699
05:48:21,360 --> 05:48:26,080
We need this stripe provider for us to make it work with stripe.

4700
05:48:26,080 --> 05:48:33,280
So essentially, in our index file, we're going to create another component and we're

4701
05:48:33,280 --> 05:48:35,680
going to remove this export default.

4702
05:48:35,680 --> 05:48:44,800
I'm going to say const payment page, and this is going to be an arrow function and

4703
05:48:44,800 --> 05:48:52,880
we are going to wrap our stripe provider that we're going to create around our payment

4704
05:48:52,880 --> 05:48:53,920
page content.

4705
05:48:53,920 --> 05:48:57,200
So this is kind of how you would work with stripe provider.

4706
05:48:57,200 --> 05:49:02,880
You need to wrap it around payment page context because they are using react context to

4707
05:49:02,880 --> 05:49:05,680
provide state into payment page content.

4708
05:49:05,680 --> 05:49:08,640
Otherwise, you won't be able to use it.

4709
05:49:08,640 --> 05:49:13,360
So we have export default payment page.

4710
05:49:13,360 --> 05:49:15,440
So we're going to do that.

4711
05:49:15,440 --> 05:49:22,880
Now we're going to go to stripe provider and inside here, I'll just do RAFCE.

4712
05:49:22,880 --> 05:49:25,760
We're going to keep it like that.

4713
05:49:25,760 --> 05:49:30,160
But for now, we're going to go and deal with environment variables.

4714
05:49:30,160 --> 05:49:40,240
So process.env.nextpublicstripe public_key.

4715
05:49:40,240 --> 05:49:42,640
Make sure you spell this correctly.

4716
05:49:42,640 --> 05:49:45,600
So this is the environment variable that we set earlier.

4717
05:49:45,600 --> 05:49:49,360
So we're going to grab this next public stripe key.

4718
05:49:49,360 --> 05:49:54,640
Make sure that if it doesn't exist, we're going to throw a new error.

4719
05:49:54,640 --> 05:49:57,360
So we always want to make sure there's some error handling.

4720
05:49:57,360 --> 05:49:58,560
Otherwise, it's not going to work.

4721
05:50:00,400 --> 05:50:02,480
Is not set is what we'll say.

4722
05:50:02,480 --> 05:50:11,680
And below this, we need to create a stripe promise so we can load stripe as we need.

4723
05:50:11,680 --> 05:50:18,560
So we're going to do process.env.nextpublicstripe public_key.

4724
05:50:18,560 --> 05:50:26,800
And this load stripe is going to come from stripe.js.

4725
05:50:26,800 --> 05:50:30,080
And it apparently does not do IntelliSense.

4726
05:50:30,080 --> 05:50:38,000
Load stripe from @stripe/stripe.js.

4727
05:50:38,000 --> 05:50:41,120
So if we do that, we should be pretty good to go.

4728
05:50:41,120 --> 05:50:50,000
And stripe has basically some value that we need to use for appearance.

4729
05:50:50,000 --> 05:50:51,920
So we have an appearance variable.

4730
05:50:52,800 --> 05:50:56,640
And we're going to grab appearance from stripe.js for the typing.

4731
05:50:56,640 --> 05:51:01,120
And we can do theme to be stripe.

4732
05:51:01,120 --> 05:51:07,040
And then we're going to set variables for our properties.

4733
05:51:07,040 --> 05:51:08,160
So color primary.

4734
05:51:08,160 --> 05:51:11,920
So I've already set this styling basically up.

4735
05:51:11,920 --> 05:51:17,440
And in this case, I'm just going to paste it because this is kind of a hassle to write.

4736
05:51:17,440 --> 05:51:22,080
But you can pause the screen, take a look at all of these colors.

4737
05:51:22,080 --> 05:51:29,200
This is basically setting up our stripe component to look and feel consistent with our own brand.

4738
05:51:29,200 --> 05:51:30,320
OK.

4739
05:51:30,320 --> 05:51:37,120
So from here, we also need to pass in children for our stripe provider because we are using

4740
05:51:37,120 --> 05:51:42,240
a parenting style of React where we pass it in.

4741
05:51:42,240 --> 05:51:48,640
And over here, we are going to grab the client secret.

4742
05:51:48,640 --> 05:51:54,080
Now, if you remember set client secret or I mean the client secret that we talked about,

4743
05:51:54,080 --> 05:51:56,000
that is coming from our back end.

4744
05:51:56,000 --> 05:52:00,560
And we need to use that so that we can connect to stripe.

4745
05:52:00,560 --> 05:52:03,520
So this is the whole purpose of stripe payment intent.

4746
05:52:03,520 --> 05:52:06,720
It allows us to connect to stripe directly.

4747
05:52:06,720 --> 05:52:09,120
But we need to do it from our back end.

4748
05:52:09,120 --> 05:52:15,520
So we're going to do a string like this and make sure we import use state.

4749
05:52:17,360 --> 05:52:22,240
We're also going to grab create stripe payment intent.

4750
05:52:22,240 --> 05:52:28,160
And this is going to come from the mutation that we created for stripe payment.

4751
05:52:28,160 --> 05:52:37,440
And we're also going to grab our course with using use current course like so.

4752
05:52:37,440 --> 05:52:42,480
As I mentioned, we are using this hook multiple times.

4753
05:52:44,240 --> 05:52:48,320
And to use our payment, we need to actually use use effect.

4754
05:52:48,320 --> 05:52:55,200
Inside here, we are going to do if course doesn't exist, we're going to return.

4755
05:52:55,200 --> 05:53:04,480
But if it does exist, we're going to say fetch payment intent with async arrow function.

4756
05:53:04,480 --> 05:53:11,040
We're going to do result const result is equal to await create stripe payment intent.

4757
05:53:12,000 --> 05:53:16,240
We're going to pass in the mount colon course comma dot price.

4758
05:53:16,240 --> 05:53:20,240
But we need to handle the edge case just in case it doesn't exist.

4759
05:53:20,240 --> 05:53:22,800
And we're just going to put a ridiculously large number

4760
05:53:22,800 --> 05:53:28,080
so that no one can actually get charged if that were to happen.

4761
05:53:28,080 --> 05:53:31,040
Let's actually make this higher.

4762
05:53:31,040 --> 05:53:37,200
So this should be dot unwrap like so.

4763
05:53:39,040 --> 05:53:46,880
And then set client secret will be the result dot client secret that we set.

4764
05:53:46,880 --> 05:53:55,040
And finally, we are going to invoke that function we just created,

4765
05:53:55,040 --> 05:53:57,440
fetch payment intent.

4766
05:53:57,440 --> 05:54:01,920
And this will grab the stripe payment.

4767
05:54:06,880 --> 05:54:10,800
Dot price and then course, so these are the dependencies for the use effect.

4768
05:54:10,800 --> 05:54:14,000
So this is how you would use stripe provider.

4769
05:54:14,000 --> 05:54:17,120
This is essentially their process of doing so.

4770
05:54:17,120 --> 05:54:20,960
Then we need to set the options.

4771
05:54:20,960 --> 05:54:24,000
We're going to do stripe elements options.

4772
05:54:24,000 --> 05:54:27,520
We need to import that from stripe as well.

4773
05:54:27,520 --> 05:54:33,120
And we are going to set the client secret and appearance.

4774
05:54:33,120 --> 05:54:36,320
So those are the settings that we are passing into stripe.

4775
05:54:37,200 --> 05:54:44,320
And if client secret doesn't exist, we are going to return a loading component.

4776
05:54:44,320 --> 05:54:54,160
And inside our div, this should instead just be elements.

4777
05:54:54,160 --> 05:54:58,160
From react stripe JS.

4778
05:54:58,720 --> 05:55:06,640
So we need to import this manually elements from at stripe slash react stripe JS.

4779
05:55:06,640 --> 05:55:14,240
So this will allow us to give us the component like the card component directly.

4780
05:55:14,240 --> 05:55:15,680
And it makes it look pretty nice.

4781
05:55:15,680 --> 05:55:22,640
So stripe promise with options is equal to options like so.

4782
05:55:22,640 --> 05:55:25,680
And we need to pass in children.

4783
05:55:26,720 --> 05:55:28,720
So that gives us the stripe provider.

4784
05:55:28,720 --> 05:55:36,720
This is everything we need for it to connect to stripe directly from our UI to our back end and then to stripe.

4785
05:55:36,720 --> 05:55:41,760
So by doing so, we can now import stripe provider.

4786
05:55:41,760 --> 05:55:46,160
And from here, we can now create the payment page content.

4787
05:55:46,160 --> 05:55:51,760
So everything that we need to set up normally for this payment page, we can then implement over here.

4788
05:55:52,640 --> 05:55:55,680
But there are a couple of things that we are allowed to use now.

4789
05:55:55,680 --> 05:56:00,560
So that's going to include stripe from you stripe like so.

4790
05:56:00,560 --> 05:56:06,880
And const elements is equal to use elements like so.

4791
05:56:06,880 --> 05:56:13,680
So if we didn't set up the stripe provider around this payment page content as the children,

4792
05:56:13,680 --> 05:56:16,960
we would not be able to access these hooks.

4793
05:56:16,960 --> 05:56:23,280
That's why this particular section is necessary for us to create this payment page content.

4794
05:56:23,280 --> 05:56:26,800
All right, it is important.

4795
05:56:26,800 --> 05:56:30,080
From here, we're going to create a transaction.

4796
05:56:30,080 --> 05:56:35,920
And we're going to put this on halt.

4797
05:56:35,920 --> 05:56:38,560
So this is going to be a function that we'll create.

4798
05:56:38,560 --> 05:56:40,800
This is like an API call or create.

4799
05:56:40,800 --> 05:56:42,400
We'll just comment this out.

4800
05:56:43,360 --> 05:56:46,560
But for now, we are going to navigate to step.

4801
05:56:46,560 --> 05:56:52,160
We're going to use use checkout navigation to grab that function.

4802
05:56:52,160 --> 05:56:56,080
We're going to grab the course and the course ID.

4803
05:56:56,080 --> 05:57:02,640
Once again, this hook is very useful because it allows us to grab the course in one go.

4804
05:57:02,640 --> 05:57:08,400
And we're also going to grab the user from use user, which is coming from clerk next.

4805
05:57:08,400 --> 05:57:09,120
Yes.

4806
05:57:09,120 --> 05:57:14,720
And we're also going to handle the sign out functionality from use clerk.

4807
05:57:14,720 --> 05:57:20,240
And that will be provided for this particular page.

4808
05:57:20,240 --> 05:57:23,200
If you go over here, switch account.

4809
05:57:23,200 --> 05:57:30,560
If you hit this account, it's going to log you out and take you back to checkout step page one.

4810
05:57:30,560 --> 05:57:34,000
Make sure we import that correctly as well.

4811
05:57:35,040 --> 05:57:42,640
So over here, I'm going to make sure if is course is not logged out, we're going to return

4812
05:57:42,640 --> 05:57:44,160
null in this case.

4813
05:57:44,160 --> 05:57:53,360
And inside here, I'm going to do class name payment underscore like that.

4814
05:57:53,360 --> 05:57:56,160
I actually keep it like this for now.

4815
05:57:56,160 --> 05:58:00,560
Copy this because we're going to be reusing that class multiple times.

4816
05:58:00,560 --> 05:58:04,960
So I'm going to do div class name payment underscore container.

4817
05:58:04,960 --> 05:58:08,160
Close it out like that.

4818
05:58:08,160 --> 05:58:10,720
Let's get rid of this text because we don't need it.

4819
05:58:10,720 --> 05:58:17,840
And we're going to have again in order summary, which is the course preview.

4820
05:58:17,840 --> 05:58:22,240
And we're going to do div class name payment underscore preview.

4821
05:58:27,680 --> 05:58:32,800
Like we did before, and we can bring in course preview.

4822
05:58:32,800 --> 05:58:37,360
There's a reason why we created it in the components folder because we are going to

4823
05:58:37,360 --> 05:58:37,920
reuse it.

4824
05:58:37,920 --> 05:58:46,800
We can save that and then go to payment form as a comment.

4825
05:58:46,800 --> 05:58:51,760
It's nice to make sure we have kind of all of this separated out to make it easier.

4826
05:58:52,720 --> 05:58:58,800
We're going to have a div the class name payment form dash container.

4827
05:58:58,800 --> 05:59:06,000
Inside here, we're going to have a form with ID of payment.

4828
05:59:06,000 --> 05:59:08,800
Dash form.

4829
05:59:08,800 --> 05:59:12,320
With an on submit handler.

4830
05:59:12,320 --> 05:59:19,680
And we're going to do handle submit, which is a function we have not created.

4831
05:59:19,680 --> 05:59:21,360
So I'm just going to comment this out.

4832
05:59:23,360 --> 05:59:29,920
And I'm going to pass in class name payment underscore form like so closed out the form

4833
05:59:29,920 --> 05:59:30,480
component.

4834
05:59:30,480 --> 05:59:37,840
And over here, we have a div class name payment underscore content.

4835
05:59:37,840 --> 05:59:43,120
So have an H1 tag class name payment underscore title.

4836
05:59:43,120 --> 05:59:45,920
Close this out with checkout.

4837
05:59:47,680 --> 05:59:52,400
And then we're going to have a P tag class name payment sub title.

4838
05:59:52,400 --> 06:00:01,040
And we're just going to say fill out the payment details below to complete your purchase.

4839
06:00:01,040 --> 06:00:09,920
And then below the P tag, we're going to do another div class name payment underscore

4840
06:00:09,920 --> 06:00:10,320
method.

4841
06:00:10,320 --> 06:00:17,280
And we're going to have an H3 tag class name payment underscore method dash title.

4842
06:00:18,080 --> 06:00:21,200
This should be the payment method.

4843
06:00:21,200 --> 06:00:29,840
Below this H3, we're going to do a div class name payment card.

4844
06:00:29,840 --> 06:00:38,160
Didn't mean to do that payment underscore card dash container.

4845
06:00:38,160 --> 06:00:41,120
Close this out.

4846
06:00:41,120 --> 06:00:46,560
We're going to have another div class name payment underscore card dash header.

4847
06:00:47,360 --> 06:00:48,000
Close this.

4848
06:00:48,000 --> 06:00:57,360
And we're going to pass in credit card, which is a Lucid React icon with a size of 24.

4849
06:00:57,360 --> 06:01:00,000
Close this out.

4850
06:01:00,000 --> 06:01:12,800
Have a span of credit slash debit card.

4851
06:01:14,080 --> 06:01:19,040
And then below this, we're going to have a div class name payment underscore card dash

4852
06:01:19,040 --> 06:01:21,280
element.

4853
06:01:21,280 --> 06:01:28,960
And we're going to have a payment element component from React Stripe JS.

4854
06:01:28,960 --> 06:01:33,920
So all of this work is so that we can use the payment element component, which will

4855
06:01:33,920 --> 06:01:40,800
provide us with a nice little component that makes it easier to have an input from Stripe

4856
06:01:40,800 --> 06:01:43,040
so that they can put their credit card information.

4857
06:01:43,040 --> 06:01:44,720
And it makes it look pretty nice.

4858
06:01:44,720 --> 06:01:48,720
So now there's a lot of closing div tags.

4859
06:01:48,720 --> 06:01:56,400
What we want to do is go all the way after the second closing div tag from the form and

4860
06:01:56,400 --> 06:01:59,840
below or above the last closing div.

4861
06:01:59,840 --> 06:02:03,040
And we are going to add the navigation buttons over here.

4862
06:02:03,040 --> 06:02:11,520
So over here, we're going to have a div the class name payment actions like so.

4863
06:02:12,240 --> 06:02:15,440
We're going to pass in button component from ShadZn.

4864
06:02:15,440 --> 06:02:27,280
Give it a class name of hover with background white of 50 with 10 opacity on click.

4865
06:02:27,280 --> 06:02:33,120
We are going to do handle sign out and navigate.

4866
06:02:33,120 --> 06:02:39,040
So we have not created that yet, but that's going to handle the sign out for the switch

4867
06:02:39,040 --> 06:02:40,240
account button.

4868
06:02:41,680 --> 06:02:50,640
So we're going to have a variant of outline with a type of button like so.

4869
06:02:50,640 --> 06:02:54,560
And we're going to say switch account.

4870
06:02:54,560 --> 06:02:59,840
And then finally, we are going to have one more button.

4871
06:02:59,840 --> 06:03:04,560
I'm just going to copy this to make it easier.

4872
06:03:06,400 --> 06:03:16,320
But this time, this is going to be a form with payment form type should be submit this

4873
06:03:16,320 --> 06:03:16,820
time.

4874
06:03:16,820 --> 06:03:24,160
Because this one will be the one to submit the actual form that we created with the class

4875
06:03:24,160 --> 06:03:26,960
name payment underscore submit.

4876
06:03:26,960 --> 06:03:35,440
We're going to get rid of the variant, get rid of this on click, and we are going to

4877
06:03:35,440 --> 06:03:44,640
set disabled if stripe or elements has not been loaded.

4878
06:03:44,640 --> 06:03:49,360
So this is going to say pay with credit card.

4879
06:03:49,360 --> 06:03:57,920
And then let's go back to checkout wizard and we are going to import payment page and

4880
06:03:57,920 --> 06:03:59,920
let's double check how it looks.

4881
06:03:59,920 --> 06:04:03,520
So this is our payment page.

4882
06:04:03,520 --> 06:04:09,120
We have the course preview that we already know and see the sections.

4883
06:04:09,120 --> 06:04:15,360
And then now we can see that we have credit debit card, secure checkout with link.

4884
06:04:15,360 --> 06:04:18,400
I don't know if you'll see that.

4885
06:04:18,400 --> 06:04:21,600
Not exactly sure if you'll see that.

4886
06:04:21,600 --> 06:04:25,760
I think that's only if you're on the Brave browser.

4887
06:04:25,760 --> 06:04:29,120
OK, it is not a brave browser.

4888
06:04:29,120 --> 06:04:34,720
If you go to create next app, basically, if you go to this page where you're in settings

4889
06:04:34,720 --> 06:04:44,800
and then you go to payments, payment methods, it'll show you the things that you are on.

4890
06:04:44,800 --> 06:04:45,840
You have this link.

4891
06:04:45,840 --> 06:04:51,360
You can deactivate it if you want, but all the settings for your payment checkout is

4892
06:04:51,360 --> 06:04:55,760
going to be based on the settings that you have in your stripe dashboard, which is pretty

4893
06:04:55,760 --> 06:04:56,260
nice.

4894
06:04:57,040 --> 06:05:01,840
So, yeah, so we'll have this basically and we'll have pay with credit card, switch account

4895
06:05:01,840 --> 06:05:06,000
if we want to log out and this should be pretty much all set.

4896
06:05:06,000 --> 06:05:11,840
Now, like I said before, with the handle submit, it's going to involve a number of things.

4897
06:05:11,840 --> 06:05:15,840
If you go back over here, we need to create a transaction.

4898
06:05:15,840 --> 06:05:17,680
We need to create a stripe payment.

4899
06:05:17,680 --> 06:05:22,240
We need to create a course and we need to do create a user course progress.

4900
06:05:22,240 --> 06:05:26,080
So let's actually go back to our back end and let's set all of that.

4901
06:05:27,200 --> 06:05:32,240
Up before we create our handle, submit component, handle, submit function.

4902
06:05:32,240 --> 06:05:36,880
So on our back end, we're going to go to controllers.

4903
06:05:36,880 --> 06:05:43,200
We're going to go back to a transaction controllers and right above or right below the create

4904
06:05:43,200 --> 06:05:44,560
stripe payment intent.

4905
06:05:44,560 --> 06:05:51,280
We can create another function and let's just let's just copy this entire thing right here.

4906
06:05:54,480 --> 06:05:57,920
And then we could just erase everything inside.

4907
06:05:57,920 --> 06:06:03,680
We don't really need all of this, but we're going to call this create transaction.

4908
06:06:03,680 --> 06:06:07,520
With the lowercase r.

4909
06:06:07,520 --> 06:06:13,680
Inside of here, we're going to grab a lot of information from the front end.

4910
06:06:13,680 --> 06:06:22,000
So that includes user ID, course ID, transaction ID, the amount and the payment provider.

4911
06:06:23,280 --> 06:06:25,760
And we're going to grab this from rec.body.

4912
06:06:25,760 --> 06:06:35,280
So the first step we need to do is get course info and we need to grab the course info so

4913
06:06:35,280 --> 06:06:42,080
we are able to grab and update our course appropriately or to make sure that the course

4914
06:06:42,080 --> 06:06:46,240
exists and so that we can connect it to our transaction.

4915
06:06:46,240 --> 06:06:52,160
So we're going to do course.get course ID and we need to make sure we import the course

4916
06:06:52,160 --> 06:06:54,560
from our models directory.

4917
06:06:54,560 --> 06:07:01,520
Then we need to create transaction record.

4918
06:07:01,520 --> 06:07:09,200
So the way we create our transaction record, we can just do a new transaction and we are

4919
06:07:09,200 --> 06:07:14,320
going to set transaction, which is going to come from our transaction model.

4920
06:07:15,600 --> 06:07:22,160
And we are going to put every property, you know, like date time.

4921
06:07:22,160 --> 06:07:29,840
So we need to set a new date to iso string for the time of our transaction.

4922
06:07:29,840 --> 06:07:42,240
We also need to set the user ID, course ID, transaction ID, amount and payment provider.

4923
06:07:44,080 --> 06:07:52,880
And then we do that, we create the transaction, but we also need to save it into our database.

4924
06:07:52,880 --> 06:07:56,960
So that takes care of this part right here.

4925
06:07:56,960 --> 06:07:58,480
So this creates the transaction.

4926
06:07:58,480 --> 06:08:03,440
And if you want to double check, we can go to the transaction model.

4927
06:08:03,440 --> 06:08:05,840
This includes all the properties that we have.

4928
06:08:05,840 --> 06:08:07,360
So it makes a lot of sense.

4929
06:08:07,360 --> 06:08:10,960
Oops, didn't mean to do that.

4930
06:08:12,080 --> 06:08:16,320
Then we also need to create the user course progress right here.

4931
06:08:16,320 --> 06:08:20,960
So to do that, we're going to do initial progress.

4932
06:08:20,960 --> 06:08:23,440
And this is why we needed to fetch the course information.

4933
06:08:23,440 --> 06:08:26,480
Otherwise, we would not be able to create this.

4934
06:08:26,480 --> 06:08:28,960
So we're going to do new user course progress.

4935
06:08:28,960 --> 06:08:40,000
Passing an object with user ID, course ID, enrollment date is going to be the same thing

4936
06:08:40,000 --> 06:08:45,360
that we have over here with the new date, meaning it is the current time.

4937
06:08:45,360 --> 06:08:49,920
With an overall progress of zero, meaning they just started.

4938
06:08:49,920 --> 06:08:54,160
And then we are also going to pass in sections.

4939
06:08:54,160 --> 06:08:59,680
Now sections is probably the most complicated part of courses because it is very nested.

4940
06:08:59,680 --> 06:09:05,040
We have section colon any, and we're going to have an arrow function.

4941
06:09:05,600 --> 06:09:13,600
And we are passing in an object with section ID with section dot section ID like so with

4942
06:09:13,600 --> 06:09:20,080
chapters and then section dot chapters dot map with chapter colon any.

4943
06:09:20,080 --> 06:09:29,680
And then we have an arrow function like so chapter ID colon chapter dot chapter ID.

4944
06:09:30,720 --> 06:09:37,600
And I know it's a little ridiculous, but for every time we need to track the progress of

4945
06:09:37,600 --> 06:09:41,200
each chapter and we'll go more in details for this.

4946
06:09:41,200 --> 06:09:43,840
But this is just updating the initial progress.

4947
06:09:43,840 --> 06:09:45,840
We're just setting this up.

4948
06:09:45,840 --> 06:09:50,080
And we're also going to do last accessed timestamp.

4949
06:09:50,080 --> 06:09:54,960
Like so timestamp.

4950
06:09:56,320 --> 06:09:59,040
Paste the new date ISO string.

4951
06:09:59,040 --> 06:10:04,960
And we are missing in closing parentheses, so make sure you have the correct parentheses

4952
06:10:04,960 --> 06:10:05,440
right there.

4953
06:10:05,440 --> 06:10:11,040
And then we're going to do a wait initial progress dot save.

4954
06:10:11,040 --> 06:10:12,000
So we save that.

4955
06:10:12,000 --> 06:10:16,160
And then that takes care of the user course progress.

4956
06:10:16,160 --> 06:10:20,160
But we also need to add the enrollment to the specific course.

4957
06:10:20,160 --> 06:10:22,960
And that one's pretty simple this time.

4958
06:10:22,960 --> 06:10:26,240
So we're going to do a wait course dot update.

4959
06:10:26,240 --> 06:10:32,400
And we are going to pass in course ID like so.

4960
06:10:32,400 --> 06:10:40,080
And we can do this simple dollar sign add colon enrollments.

4961
06:10:40,080 --> 06:10:45,520
And pass in an array with object of user ID.

4962
06:10:45,520 --> 06:10:48,160
So let's save that.

4963
06:10:49,440 --> 06:10:55,360
So for here, I'm just going to say create initial course progress.

4964
06:10:55,360 --> 06:10:59,360
It's better if we have these steps written in comments.

4965
06:10:59,360 --> 06:11:06,160
Add enrollment to relevant course.

4966
06:11:06,160 --> 06:11:11,280
So we now have everything we need that we set up.

4967
06:11:11,280 --> 06:11:12,960
We just don't have the Stripe payment.

4968
06:11:12,960 --> 06:11:17,120
We haven't created the Stripe payment directly on the front end.

4969
06:11:17,920 --> 06:11:20,880
But that will happen in the component that we created earlier.

4970
06:11:20,880 --> 06:11:24,400
So this res dot JSON, we're going to have a message.

4971
06:11:24,400 --> 06:11:28,720
We're going to say purchase course successfully.

4972
06:11:28,720 --> 06:11:31,440
Like this.

4973
06:11:31,440 --> 06:11:38,400
And the data should be transaction would be a new transaction like so.

4974
06:11:38,400 --> 06:11:44,880
And we can also pass in course progress to be the initial progress that we saved.

4975
06:11:47,200 --> 06:11:54,320
And then below this, we can say error creating transaction and enrollment.

4976
06:11:54,320 --> 06:11:59,520
So that will be our transaction.

4977
06:11:59,520 --> 06:12:03,440
That covers everything we need when we create a Stripe payment.

4978
06:12:03,440 --> 06:12:04,800
So this is all important.

4979
06:12:04,800 --> 06:12:07,280
It's a lot of data in different tables.

4980
06:12:07,280 --> 06:12:10,800
And we basically needed all of those.

4981
06:12:10,800 --> 06:12:14,320
So we can now go back to transaction routes.

4982
06:12:15,600 --> 06:12:19,600
And over here, we're just going to do router dot post with it.

4983
06:12:19,600 --> 06:12:27,200
Empty domain, we're going to say create transaction, grab it from the controllers.

4984
06:12:27,200 --> 06:12:30,720
So that sets up our routes, close both of these.

4985
06:12:30,720 --> 06:12:34,880
And then we can now go back to our API.

4986
06:12:34,880 --> 06:12:37,520
Let me close this out.

4987
06:12:40,320 --> 06:12:49,840
We can set a little endpoint in our API Redux toolkit query, call this create transaction.

4988
06:12:49,840 --> 06:12:56,000
We're going to call this copy this build dot mutation, we're going to put transaction.

4989
06:12:56,000 --> 06:13:00,720
And we're going to put partial transaction.

4990
06:13:00,720 --> 06:13:03,760
So that's what we are going to send to the back end.

4991
06:13:03,760 --> 06:13:10,240
Put an object, we're going to do query with transaction inside here.

4992
06:13:12,160 --> 06:13:17,680
Return an object that says URL transactions like so.

4993
06:13:17,680 --> 06:13:26,560
This is going to be a method of post with the body of transaction that we will send.

4994
06:13:26,560 --> 06:13:32,560
We don't need any kind of tags for this.

4995
06:13:32,560 --> 06:13:40,720
So we can scroll down, go over here, and we can say use create transaction mutation.

4996
06:13:40,720 --> 06:13:48,800
And now we can close these guys out, except for this payment page content.

4997
06:13:48,800 --> 06:13:54,960
We're going to open this up and import our mutation from our API.

4998
06:13:54,960 --> 06:13:58,640
So we now have this create transaction function that we can use.

4999
06:13:59,280 --> 06:14:02,880
So the first thing I want to handle is the handle submit.

5000
06:14:02,880 --> 06:14:07,120
What happens when we click the pay with credit card from the front end.

5001
06:14:07,120 --> 06:14:14,880
So we're going to have a handle submit async with e dot react dot form event.

5002
06:14:14,880 --> 06:14:18,000
You're going to use an arrow function like so.

5003
06:14:18,000 --> 06:14:20,560
You're going to do e dot prevent default.

5004
06:14:21,360 --> 06:14:34,320
And if stripe or elements does not exist, we are going to say toast error and make sure we

5005
06:14:34,320 --> 06:14:37,360
grab the toast from Sunner.

5006
06:14:37,360 --> 06:14:45,360
And we are going to give it a string of stripe service is not available.

5007
06:14:45,360 --> 06:14:48,000
Good to have these error checks.

5008
06:14:48,000 --> 06:14:48,960
So we're going to return.

5009
06:14:50,000 --> 06:14:57,920
And then we're also going to do result is equal to a weight stripe dot confirm payment.

5010
06:14:57,920 --> 06:15:00,720
Elements.

5011
06:15:00,720 --> 06:15:05,840
So that grabs the elements information like the inputs that we had.

5012
06:15:05,840 --> 06:15:09,280
They already handle it behind the scenes.

5013
06:15:09,280 --> 06:15:12,640
And we're going to confirm the params of return URL.

5014
06:15:13,680 --> 06:15:19,920
And we are going to use the process dot env dot.

5015
06:15:19,920 --> 06:15:22,980
Next.

5016
06:15:22,980 --> 06:15:25,040
Public.

5017
06:15:25,040 --> 06:15:27,200
So this is the environment variable that we created.

5018
06:15:27,200 --> 06:15:30,560
Stripe redirect URL.

5019
06:15:30,560 --> 06:15:34,560
We're going to have an ID, of course.

5020
06:15:34,560 --> 06:15:37,280
ID like so.

5021
06:15:38,720 --> 06:15:43,760
And we are going to make sure redirect if required.

5022
06:15:43,760 --> 06:15:47,840
So this right here is that stripe payment.

5023
06:15:47,840 --> 06:15:51,520
This is where we are creating this stripe payment directly on there.

5024
06:15:51,520 --> 06:16:01,760
And finally, we want to say if result dot payment intent dot status has succeeded.

5025
06:16:01,760 --> 06:16:02,720
Just to double check.

5026
06:16:05,760 --> 06:16:12,800
We can now create the transaction data that we need to send to the back end.

5027
06:16:12,800 --> 06:16:15,920
And we're going to make sure we type it correctly.

5028
06:16:15,920 --> 06:16:21,280
And then we have transaction ID with the result payment ID.

5029
06:16:21,280 --> 06:16:30,320
So the transaction ID is coming from stripe payment ID.

5030
06:16:30,320 --> 06:16:36,720
So if we ever need to grab information from stripe about the payment transactions,

5031
06:16:36,720 --> 06:16:38,640
this is the ID that we're using.

5032
06:16:38,640 --> 06:16:41,760
And it's coming directly from stripe.

5033
06:16:41,760 --> 06:16:48,160
So it's important to understand that our transaction table basically has connections

5034
06:16:48,160 --> 06:16:50,640
to the stripe information.

5035
06:16:50,640 --> 06:16:52,720
This is very important.

5036
06:16:52,720 --> 06:16:58,800
Sometimes you really do need the link so that you are able to grab user transaction information

5037
06:16:58,800 --> 06:16:59,600
from stripe.

5038
06:16:59,600 --> 06:17:04,640
Otherwise, you have no way of knowing which users are which, which is very bad.

5039
06:17:04,640 --> 06:17:10,240
And then also for the user ID, that's going to come from clerk.

5040
06:17:10,240 --> 06:17:12,880
So we have the user dot ID.

5041
06:17:12,880 --> 06:17:16,640
Course ID is obviously the course ID that was selected.

5042
06:17:16,640 --> 06:17:19,280
And it's coming from the search params.

5043
06:17:19,280 --> 06:17:21,920
Payment provider.

5044
06:17:21,920 --> 06:17:24,000
In this case, we're only having stripe.

5045
06:17:24,000 --> 06:17:25,680
So it's pretty redundant.

5046
06:17:25,680 --> 06:17:30,160
But if you ever wanted to add things like PayPal, you can have this as different.

5047
06:17:30,160 --> 06:17:33,840
And the amount of this is course dot price.

5048
06:17:33,840 --> 06:17:35,680
Otherwise, we're going to set this to be zero.

5049
06:17:35,680 --> 06:17:40,000
We're going to set await create transaction.

5050
06:17:40,000 --> 06:17:42,720
And we're going to pass in transaction data.

5051
06:17:42,720 --> 06:17:48,560
And we are going to navigate to step three.

5052
06:17:48,560 --> 06:17:54,720
So after our transaction completes, we are going to go to step three.

5053
06:17:55,520 --> 06:17:57,520
And that's pretty much our handle submit.

5054
06:17:57,520 --> 06:17:59,440
This is everything we need to do.

5055
06:17:59,440 --> 06:18:04,480
So if we go down, we see our on submit, we have our handle submit.

5056
06:18:04,480 --> 06:18:07,760
So that will handle our payment.

5057
06:18:07,760 --> 06:18:16,800
And then finally, for the switch account, we're going to have handle sign out and navigate

5058
06:18:16,800 --> 06:18:20,640
function, which we are going to set is going to be an arrow function.

5059
06:18:21,200 --> 06:18:26,400
Like so we're going to do await sign out is coming from that function.

5060
06:18:26,400 --> 06:18:29,680
And we are going to navigate to step one like this.

5061
06:18:29,680 --> 06:18:37,280
And we're going to scroll down to this button on comment what we did earlier.

5062
06:18:37,280 --> 06:18:40,080
And we did spell this wrong.

5063
06:18:40,080 --> 06:18:42,000
The end should be capitalized.

5064
06:18:42,000 --> 06:18:45,360
And over here, we're going to do 424242.

5065
06:18:45,360 --> 06:18:50,800
So if you want to test out stripe, you would use 42424242 like that.

5066
06:18:51,360 --> 06:18:53,200
And I'm just going to put 033.

5067
06:18:53,200 --> 06:18:54,960
It doesn't after this.

5068
06:18:54,960 --> 06:18:56,320
It doesn't really matter.

5069
06:18:56,320 --> 06:19:03,520
This allows you to basically, basically just use any value that you want.

5070
06:19:03,520 --> 06:19:10,160
So as long as you use this one, which is stripes test account, this you should be good to go.

5071
06:19:10,160 --> 06:19:16,640
We can ignore that and we can select pay with credit card and say no thanks.

5072
06:19:18,320 --> 06:19:23,680
And when it says purchased course successfully, that means everything should have worked as

5073
06:19:23,680 --> 06:19:24,320
expected.

5074
06:19:24,320 --> 06:19:32,080
And the way we can check is if we go to no SQL workbench, we can go back to our connection

5075
06:19:32,080 --> 06:19:39,600
and we can test out to see if we got a new transaction.

5076
06:19:39,600 --> 06:19:44,320
And right here is what we just, you know, added.

5077
06:19:44,320 --> 06:19:47,120
This is specifically new date that we had.

5078
06:19:47,120 --> 06:19:50,240
Otherwise everything else is 320.

5079
06:19:50,240 --> 06:19:52,000
So this is all like mock data.

5080
06:19:52,000 --> 06:19:58,080
But the one we just created was today right here, 2024, three right here.

5081
06:19:58,080 --> 06:20:01,440
So yeah, everything is working expected.

5082
06:20:01,440 --> 06:20:04,080
So let's get to the completion page.

5083
06:20:04,080 --> 06:20:07,680
So we're going to open up right here, create a new folder.

5084
06:20:07,680 --> 06:20:09,760
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

5085
06:20:11,760 --> 06:20:20,880
Let's create a new folder called completion and create a new file called index, index.tsx.

5086
06:20:20,880 --> 06:20:30,160
And inside our checkout wizard, we're just going to do completion page like so.

5087
06:20:30,160 --> 06:20:32,240
We haven't created it yet.

5088
06:20:32,240 --> 06:20:35,680
So we're going to create it completion page.

5089
06:20:35,680 --> 06:20:39,920
And this should be pretty simple.

5090
06:20:39,920 --> 06:20:42,800
We're just going to have a class name with completion.

5091
06:20:42,800 --> 06:20:47,120
Remove this completion page text.

5092
06:20:47,120 --> 06:20:49,040
We're going to have a div class name.

5093
06:20:49,040 --> 06:20:52,880
I'm going to copy this right here.

5094
06:20:52,880 --> 06:20:57,040
So it's easier for us to finish this content like so.

5095
06:20:57,040 --> 06:21:02,240
We're going to have another div completion icon like so.

5096
06:21:02,240 --> 06:21:06,320
And then we're going to import check from Lucide React.

5097
06:21:06,320 --> 06:21:11,120
We're going to have a class name with width of 16, height of 16.

5098
06:21:11,120 --> 06:21:12,880
We're going to close that out.

5099
06:21:12,880 --> 06:21:19,360
Below this, I'm going to have an h1 tag class name, completion title.

5100
06:21:19,360 --> 06:21:21,520
We're going to do completed.

5101
06:21:21,520 --> 06:21:31,200
And below this, we're going to have a p tag completion underscore message like so.

5102
06:21:32,160 --> 06:21:37,520
And you can have this emoji right here.

5103
06:21:37,520 --> 06:21:39,200
I just copied and pasted it.

5104
06:21:39,200 --> 06:21:40,720
You can figure out how to do that.

5105
06:21:40,720 --> 06:21:48,720
I'm going to say you have made a course purchase success fully.

5106
06:21:48,720 --> 06:21:50,480
I'm going to paste that.

5107
06:21:50,480 --> 06:21:54,640
And then below this, we're going to have another div.

5108
06:21:54,640 --> 06:21:57,300
Oops.

5109
06:21:58,240 --> 06:22:02,160
Completion like so with support.

5110
06:22:02,160 --> 06:22:05,200
We're going to have a p tag.

5111
06:22:05,200 --> 06:22:12,160
We're going to say need help contact our string with space.

5112
06:22:12,160 --> 06:22:16,080
We're going to import a button from ShadCN.

5113
06:22:18,240 --> 06:22:30,000
With a variant of link as child class name with padding of zero, margin of zero, text

5114
06:22:30,000 --> 06:22:34,400
primary of 700.

5115
06:22:34,400 --> 06:22:46,720
We're going to have an a tag with href is equal to mail to colon support at example.com.

5116
06:22:47,280 --> 06:22:53,680
We're going to put custom or support and put after all this, a period.

5117
06:22:53,680 --> 06:22:56,800
Close this out with a div.

5118
06:22:56,800 --> 06:23:01,200
We're going to have class name, completion action.

5119
06:23:01,200 --> 06:23:04,480
And finally, just a link from next.

5120
06:23:04,480 --> 06:23:09,360
Href should be user slash courses.

5121
06:23:09,360 --> 06:23:13,920
And we can do go to courses.

5122
06:23:15,520 --> 06:23:16,400
I'm going to save that.

5123
06:23:16,400 --> 06:23:20,240
Go to our page with checkout wizard.

5124
06:23:20,240 --> 06:23:22,880
Make sure we import that correctly.

5125
06:23:22,880 --> 06:23:30,720
And for this safe return, we're just going to just place checkout details page just for that.

5126
06:23:30,720 --> 06:23:35,120
Once we have set that, we have our completion page.

5127
06:23:35,120 --> 06:23:41,680
Now, as the last part of the checkout flow, we want to create this particular table of

5128
06:23:41,680 --> 06:23:47,520
grabbing the transactions from our database and putting it in the billing page.

5129
06:23:47,520 --> 06:23:49,040
So we just want to do that.

5130
06:23:49,040 --> 06:23:53,840
So we need to create an endpoint that list all the transactions.

5131
06:23:53,840 --> 06:23:58,560
And then we just need to create the UI on the front end for those transactions.

5132
06:23:58,560 --> 06:24:01,840
So we're going to go back to transaction controller.

5133
06:24:01,840 --> 06:24:06,160
We're going to go up, copy all of this once again.

5134
06:24:06,160 --> 06:24:10,560
And we're just going to go and paste all of this information.

5135
06:24:12,400 --> 06:24:14,240
Remove everything over here.

5136
06:24:14,240 --> 06:24:15,200
Remove all of this.

5137
06:24:15,200 --> 06:24:18,800
And we are just going to say list transactions.

5138
06:24:18,800 --> 06:24:27,440
And from here, we want to grab the user ID, which is going to be passed as a query string.

5139
06:24:27,440 --> 06:24:29,920
So rec.query.

5140
06:24:29,920 --> 06:24:33,440
So we're going to grab that information from the URL.

5141
06:24:33,440 --> 06:24:37,200
So const transactions is going to be user ID.

5142
06:24:38,080 --> 06:24:42,320
We're going to await a transaction.query.

5143
06:24:42,320 --> 06:24:44,640
Grab the user ID.

5144
06:24:44,640 --> 06:24:48,880
We're going to make sure it's equal to user ID.

5145
06:24:48,880 --> 06:24:50,640
And we are going to execute.

5146
06:24:50,640 --> 06:24:57,840
And then we are also going to await transaction.scan.execute,

5147
06:24:57,840 --> 06:25:03,360
making sure the transactions all grab the transactions.

5148
06:25:05,120 --> 06:25:08,640
So this allows us to either grab the entire list of transactions,

5149
06:25:08,640 --> 06:25:13,120
or if we have the user ID, then we just grab that user.

5150
06:25:13,120 --> 06:25:18,480
So basically, it is optional and it serves a multifunction for this particular endpoint.

5151
06:25:18,480 --> 06:25:22,160
In this case, we just need the user ID.

5152
06:25:22,160 --> 06:25:31,440
So over here, we're going to say transactions retrieved successfully.

5153
06:25:31,440 --> 06:25:33,600
This should be plural, like so.

5154
06:25:34,480 --> 06:25:39,360
And the data should be remove the object.

5155
06:25:39,360 --> 06:25:41,680
It should just be transactions, like so.

5156
06:25:41,680 --> 06:25:51,360
And we can say error retrieving transactions, like that.

5157
06:25:51,360 --> 06:25:52,480
It should be simple enough.

5158
06:25:52,480 --> 06:25:55,360
Now we're going to go back to transaction routes.

5159
06:25:55,360 --> 06:25:57,680
Go over here.

5160
06:25:57,680 --> 06:25:59,200
This should be pretty simple.

5161
06:25:59,200 --> 06:26:02,880
Router.get with a slash.

5162
06:26:02,880 --> 06:26:07,120
We're going to do list transactions and grab it from our endpoint.

5163
06:26:07,120 --> 06:26:09,920
So this should be very, very simple.

5164
06:26:09,920 --> 06:26:12,880
And now we're going to go to our front end.

5165
06:26:12,880 --> 06:26:15,760
Go to our API.

5166
06:26:15,760 --> 06:26:22,400
And go over here, right above the create stripe payment intent.

5167
06:26:22,400 --> 06:26:24,000
We're going to do get transactions.

5168
06:26:24,000 --> 06:26:27,840
And we're going to do build.query.

5169
06:26:28,560 --> 06:26:31,760
We're going to pass in the transaction interface.

5170
06:26:31,760 --> 06:26:35,360
That's going to be returned from the back end as an array.

5171
06:26:35,360 --> 06:26:39,600
And we're just going to pass in the string for our query.

5172
06:26:39,600 --> 06:26:43,120
And then we're going to have a user ID is what we're going to be using.

5173
06:26:43,120 --> 06:26:49,040
And that will be part of the query string when we call our back end.

5174
06:26:49,040 --> 06:26:53,360
So user ID is equal to user ID, like so.

5175
06:26:53,360 --> 06:26:55,520
I'm going to grab that.

5176
06:26:55,520 --> 06:26:58,160
And then we're going to scroll down.

5177
06:26:58,160 --> 06:27:03,760
We're going to do up here, use get transactions query, like so.

5178
06:27:03,760 --> 06:27:08,160
All right.

5179
06:27:08,160 --> 06:27:10,320
So from here, we can go to our app.

5180
06:27:10,320 --> 06:27:12,560
We can go to dashboard.

5181
06:27:12,560 --> 06:27:14,240
From here, we have user.

5182
06:27:14,240 --> 06:27:15,600
We're going to create a new folder.

5183
06:27:15,600 --> 06:27:17,120
And we're going to call this billing.

5184
06:27:17,120 --> 06:27:19,920
Inside here, I'm going to create a new file.

5185
06:27:19,920 --> 06:27:21,920
I'm going to call this page.tsx.

5186
06:27:21,920 --> 06:27:24,880
I'm going to close that up.

5187
06:27:24,880 --> 06:27:27,680
And over here, I'm going to do rafce.

5188
06:27:27,680 --> 06:27:30,960
This is going to be the user billing page.

5189
06:27:30,960 --> 06:27:37,280
Inside here, we're going to set a payment type.

5190
06:27:37,280 --> 06:27:41,360
We're going to set the payment type as well.

5191
06:27:41,360 --> 06:27:44,560
Let's make sure we capitalize that.

5192
06:27:44,560 --> 06:27:47,920
We're going to use state from React.

5193
06:27:47,920 --> 06:27:50,080
We're going to do all, like so.

5194
06:27:50,080 --> 06:27:54,480
And over here, I'm going to set user is loaded.

5195
06:27:56,000 --> 06:27:57,840
And set use user.

5196
06:27:57,840 --> 06:28:01,440
So this is grabbing the user from our Next.js application.

5197
06:28:01,440 --> 06:28:06,320
Because we need that user information so that we can make an API call

5198
06:28:06,320 --> 06:28:09,200
for the transactions relevant to our users.

5199
06:28:09,200 --> 06:28:11,760
So we're going to do is loading.

5200
06:28:11,760 --> 06:28:15,680
But this is going to be set to is loading transactions

5201
06:28:15,680 --> 06:28:19,200
because it's different from the other one.

5202
06:28:19,200 --> 06:28:21,040
We don't want to get it confused with this one.

5203
06:28:21,040 --> 06:28:25,600
So here, we're going to do use get transactions query.

5204
06:28:27,360 --> 06:28:28,880
And I'm going to put this on the next line.

5205
06:28:28,880 --> 06:28:35,360
And over here, we're going to do user question mark ID.

5206
06:28:35,360 --> 06:28:38,880
If it doesn't exist, we're going to have an empty string.

5207
06:28:38,880 --> 06:28:44,240
However, what we want to do is make sure this doesn't get called

5208
06:28:44,240 --> 06:28:48,320
until user ID is identified.

5209
06:28:48,320 --> 06:28:50,240
So you can use something called skip.

5210
06:28:51,360 --> 06:28:57,680
And because this, you can't really control like the timing of the React component sometimes.

5211
06:28:57,680 --> 06:29:03,680
Skip is a nice way to make sure we make the API call under certain conditions.

5212
06:29:03,680 --> 06:29:09,120
So if it isn't loaded and the user does not exist,

5213
06:29:09,120 --> 06:29:11,760
we're not going to make this API call.

5214
06:29:11,760 --> 06:29:14,560
That's exactly what the skip function is doing.

5215
06:29:14,560 --> 06:29:16,240
So that's why we pass this in.

5216
06:29:16,880 --> 06:29:25,920
So until this happens, then user ID will get passed after those conditions are met.

5217
06:29:25,920 --> 06:29:27,940
OK.

5218
06:29:27,940 --> 06:29:33,520
So from here, and it's one of the nice things again about Redux toolkit query.

5219
06:29:33,520 --> 06:29:36,800
So we have filtered data.

5220
06:29:36,800 --> 06:29:41,200
And we are going to pass in transactions.

5221
06:29:41,200 --> 06:29:46,000
And we're just going to do a quick little filter.

5222
06:29:47,120 --> 06:29:49,840
For the transaction with an arrow function.

5223
06:29:49,840 --> 06:29:57,120
So we're just filtering and we're just filtering to make sure matches the type that we have,

5224
06:29:57,120 --> 06:29:58,800
which is payment type.

5225
06:29:58,800 --> 06:30:02,480
Make sure it is equal to all of them.

5226
06:30:02,480 --> 06:30:12,320
Otherwise we say transaction.paymentProvider is equal to payment type.

5227
06:30:13,520 --> 06:30:17,520
Otherwise we just return matches type as well.

5228
06:30:17,520 --> 06:30:22,800
And we just want to make sure we have at least an empty array.

5229
06:30:22,800 --> 06:30:26,240
So basically we're just filtering based on the payment type.

5230
06:30:26,240 --> 06:30:31,360
It doesn't really do anything because we only we do only have one payment type.

5231
06:30:31,360 --> 06:30:36,320
But just in case if you ever wanted to expand this application, then you can do so.

5232
06:30:36,320 --> 06:30:42,960
And over here, we're going to return loading from the component loading.

5233
06:30:42,960 --> 06:30:47,120
And if user does not exist, we're going to return div.

5234
06:30:47,120 --> 06:30:53,440
Please sign in to view your billing information like that.

5235
06:30:53,440 --> 06:30:56,720
All right.

5236
06:30:56,720 --> 06:30:58,560
And then from here, we're going to write the div.

5237
06:30:58,560 --> 06:31:06,240
Again, we're going to have class name billing like so.

5238
06:31:06,240 --> 06:31:10,640
And make sure we copy that so we can use it for our div.

5239
06:31:11,360 --> 06:31:23,920
Div class name billing_container with h2 class name billing_title payment history.

5240
06:31:23,920 --> 06:31:30,000
And then div class name billing_filters.

5241
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:39,280
And then we're going to import select drop down from add components UI select from shadcn.

5242
06:31:40,320 --> 06:31:44,080
And we're just going to pass in value with payment type.

5243
06:31:44,080 --> 06:31:47,280
And on value change is the function.

5244
06:31:47,280 --> 06:31:51,440
We just need to set payment type like so.

5245
06:31:51,440 --> 06:31:53,520
Close that.

5246
06:31:53,520 --> 06:32:00,880
And we are going to set the select trigger from add components UI select.

5247
06:32:00,880 --> 06:32:04,720
We're going to paste billing select like so.

5248
06:32:04,720 --> 06:32:07,840
Make sure we have the right styling.

5249
06:32:07,840 --> 06:32:11,600
And then select value should come from add components.

5250
06:32:11,600 --> 06:32:16,080
Again, placeholder is going to be payment type.

5251
06:32:16,080 --> 06:32:19,040
And we're going to make sure we close that.

5252
06:32:19,040 --> 06:32:24,560
And then from here, we're going to do select content.

5253
06:32:24,560 --> 06:32:28,080
And again, make sure you import it from shadcn.

5254
06:32:28,080 --> 06:32:32,800
We're going to do class name billing_select-content.

5255
06:32:32,800 --> 06:32:37,440
Inside here, we're going to have select item.

5256
06:32:37,440 --> 06:32:40,480
So that's also going to be imported from shadcn.

5257
06:32:40,480 --> 06:32:47,840
Class name billing_select-item with value of all.

5258
06:32:47,840 --> 06:32:49,520
And we make sure we close that.

5259
06:32:49,520 --> 06:32:52,640
And inside here, I'm going to say all types.

5260
06:32:52,640 --> 06:32:58,000
And it seems like I did not correctly import it.

5261
06:32:58,000 --> 06:33:00,720
So make sure to do that.

5262
06:33:00,720 --> 06:33:05,040
I'm going to copy paste this two more times.

5263
06:33:05,040 --> 06:33:07,040
The value should be stripe.

5264
06:33:07,040 --> 06:33:11,200
And let's say if we actually added PayPal, we're going to keep it like that.

5265
06:33:11,200 --> 06:33:19,360
By the way, I did add PayPal before, but it was just too much to handle in terms of scope.

5266
06:33:19,360 --> 06:33:22,640
The scope just blew another control for this application.

5267
06:33:22,640 --> 06:33:23,680
Not exactly sure why.

5268
06:33:23,680 --> 06:33:25,920
Anyways, so we have a div.

5269
06:33:25,920 --> 06:33:32,960
And I want to copy the billing over here once again with class name billing.

5270
06:33:32,960 --> 06:33:34,640
And this time, it's going to be a grid.

5271
06:33:36,320 --> 06:33:40,160
Inside here, this is going to be our table component.

5272
06:33:40,160 --> 06:33:42,960
So our table component right here.

5273
06:33:42,960 --> 06:33:45,920
And we're just going to use simple shadcn table.

5274
06:33:45,920 --> 06:33:50,480
And I'm going to pass in is loading transactions.

5275
06:33:50,480 --> 06:33:56,080
So over here, if it's loading transactions, we're going to add the loading component.

5276
06:33:56,080 --> 06:34:01,760
And like I said, it is super useful because we are reusing that loading component.

5277
06:34:01,760 --> 06:34:05,520
And it is very useful for multiple types of scenarios.

5278
06:34:06,720 --> 06:34:07,120
All right.

5279
06:34:07,120 --> 06:34:13,120
So in here, if it is loaded, we are going to add table component.

5280
06:34:13,120 --> 06:34:15,200
And we're going to grab it from shadcn table.

5281
06:34:15,200 --> 06:34:18,720
Pass in billing table like so.

5282
06:34:18,720 --> 06:34:21,440
Then we're going to pass in table header.

5283
06:34:21,440 --> 06:34:23,680
Get it from shadcn.

5284
06:34:23,680 --> 06:34:27,600
Class name billing table dash header.

5285
06:34:27,600 --> 06:34:32,960
And then table head.

5286
06:34:34,000 --> 06:34:34,880
Pass that in.

5287
06:34:34,880 --> 06:34:41,360
Pass in the billing table dash cell.

5288
06:34:41,360 --> 06:34:42,800
Close that.

5289
06:34:42,800 --> 06:34:49,680
And I did miss one, which is table row.

5290
06:34:49,680 --> 06:34:58,400
So that should also come from the table component with class name billing table dash header dash row.

5291
06:34:58,400 --> 06:34:59,440
Pass that in.

5292
06:34:59,440 --> 06:35:03,680
And we need to make sure the table head is within the table row.

5293
06:35:05,040 --> 06:35:11,040
We're going to pass that in three times inside the table row.

5294
06:35:11,040 --> 06:35:16,080
Save it so it is unified or linted correctly.

5295
06:35:16,080 --> 06:35:25,600
And then here in the table head, we're going to have date amount and payment method.

5296
06:35:25,600 --> 06:35:29,200
That's good.

5297
06:35:29,200 --> 06:35:38,240
And then below this header, we are going to add table body shadcn component with class

5298
06:35:38,240 --> 06:35:40,160
name billing underscore.

5299
06:35:40,160 --> 06:35:46,000
Table dash body.

5300
06:35:46,000 --> 06:35:52,080
Now, the only downside about using shadcn is that you end up having a lot of these components.

5301
06:35:52,080 --> 06:35:58,960
I know it makes it more composable and more modular, makes it usable in different ways.

5302
06:35:58,960 --> 06:36:02,240
But it is sometimes kind of a pain.

5303
06:36:02,240 --> 06:36:04,640
I mean, there's always trails, right?

5304
06:36:04,640 --> 06:36:08,960
So anyways, filter data length is greater than zero.

5305
06:36:08,960 --> 06:36:15,680
So if we have any kind of value, we're going to use filter data dot map pass in transaction

5306
06:36:15,680 --> 06:36:20,080
using arrow function with table row.

5307
06:36:20,080 --> 06:36:24,480
Like so past.

5308
06:36:24,480 --> 06:36:24,980
Oops.

5309
06:36:24,980 --> 06:36:27,200
Not to do that.

5310
06:36:27,200 --> 06:36:28,960
Table row like that.

5311
06:36:28,960 --> 06:36:36,880
Let's just close that in because we are going to pass in a few things.

5312
06:36:36,880 --> 06:36:40,000
Billing table dash row.

5313
06:36:40,000 --> 06:36:46,240
But we also need to add a key, which is going to be transaction dot transaction ID.

5314
06:36:46,240 --> 06:36:50,800
Over here, we're going to add table cell.

5315
06:36:50,800 --> 06:36:56,000
Pass that in from shadcn class name billing table dash cell.

5316
06:36:56,720 --> 06:37:00,720
And we are going to copy this two more times.

5317
06:37:00,720 --> 06:37:08,880
And over here, it's going to be billing underscore amount.

5318
06:37:08,880 --> 06:37:11,600
And over here, we are just going to leave it.

5319
06:37:11,600 --> 06:37:16,960
But inside this particular table cell, we are going to add a date.

5320
06:37:16,960 --> 06:37:23,360
New date object with transaction dot date time.

5321
06:37:25,120 --> 06:37:31,680
Time to convert it to the correct date string on the front end.

5322
06:37:31,680 --> 06:37:33,280
So we pass that in.

5323
06:37:33,280 --> 06:37:36,960
And over here, we are going to do format price.

5324
06:37:36,960 --> 06:37:40,720
Make sure you import that transaction.

5325
06:37:40,720 --> 06:37:43,200
Dot amount.

5326
06:37:43,200 --> 06:37:50,480
And then over here in this table cell, we are going to do transaction payment.

5327
06:37:52,080 --> 06:37:55,280
Provider if it's equal to stripe.

5328
06:37:55,280 --> 06:38:00,080
Actually, we are just going to set it to the string.

5329
06:38:00,080 --> 06:38:00,720
That should be good.

5330
06:38:00,720 --> 06:38:06,640
And then finally, we actually have another condition.

5331
06:38:06,640 --> 06:38:13,280
So if we do not have any values, we want to pass in table row with class name.

5332
06:38:13,280 --> 06:38:18,400
Like so with billing underscore table dash row.

5333
06:38:19,360 --> 06:38:20,560
We're going to close that out.

5334
06:38:20,560 --> 06:38:23,360
Pass in table cell.

5335
06:38:23,360 --> 06:38:25,520
Let's actually grab one of these.

5336
06:38:25,520 --> 06:38:29,120
Paste it over here.

5337
06:38:29,120 --> 06:38:32,880
And then we are just going to add a property called text center.

5338
06:38:32,880 --> 06:38:39,360
Like so with column span of three.

5339
06:38:39,360 --> 06:38:44,240
Inside here, we are just going to add no transactions.

5340
06:38:44,240 --> 06:38:48,640
No transactions to display.

5341
06:38:49,040 --> 06:38:52,960
And over here, we did miss a few closing parents.

5342
06:38:52,960 --> 06:38:55,440
So make sure you have two of those.

5343
06:38:55,440 --> 06:38:58,960
And when we save it, this page should be pretty good now.

5344
06:38:58,960 --> 06:39:02,560
So everything is as expected.

5345
06:39:02,560 --> 06:39:03,760
Now let's double check.

5346
06:39:03,760 --> 06:39:06,960
Let's see if our server is running.

5347
06:39:06,960 --> 06:39:14,240
So our servers are running.

5348
06:39:14,240 --> 06:39:16,720
We're going to go click manage account.

5349
06:39:16,720 --> 06:39:18,720
Click manage account.

5350
06:39:18,720 --> 06:39:20,240
That takes us to the profile page.

5351
06:39:20,240 --> 06:39:23,440
But now we can check out the billing page.

5352
06:39:23,440 --> 06:39:26,240
So again, use state.

5353
06:39:26,240 --> 06:39:27,840
I always seem to forget.

5354
06:39:27,840 --> 06:39:30,720
We're going to put use client as well.

5355
06:39:30,720 --> 06:39:35,280
So now we do have some kind of error.

5356
06:39:35,280 --> 06:39:38,560
All right.

5357
06:39:38,560 --> 06:39:39,760
So we do have an error.

5358
06:39:39,760 --> 06:39:42,400
And that's because this is singular.

5359
06:39:42,400 --> 06:39:44,960
The URL should be plural.

5360
06:39:44,960 --> 06:39:47,760
So as you can see, when you have this error,

5361
06:39:47,760 --> 06:39:51,120
I just wanted to remind you that you can see this error happening,

5362
06:39:51,120 --> 06:39:52,400
which is very, very good.

5363
06:39:52,400 --> 06:39:54,480
You can see why we get an error.

5364
06:39:54,480 --> 06:39:59,920
And by doing so, we have our custom base query telling us that we got some kind of error.

5365
06:39:59,920 --> 06:40:05,760
So if I were to look get transaction, that's because this should be plural right here.

5366
06:40:05,760 --> 06:40:10,800
So let's refresh the page.

5367
06:40:10,800 --> 06:40:13,600
And there you go.

5368
06:40:13,600 --> 06:40:18,640
We have our list of transactions and everything is as expected.

5369
06:40:18,640 --> 06:40:24,800
If we were to do PayPal, should be no transaction.

5370
06:40:24,800 --> 06:40:28,960
If we do all types, Stripe should be working perfectly.

5371
06:40:28,960 --> 06:40:34,480
Now we want to do the exact same thing for the teacher.

5372
06:40:34,480 --> 06:40:36,720
So let's do that really, really quickly.

5373
06:40:36,720 --> 06:40:40,560
We don't need to double check because we're just going to copy this entire page.

5374
06:40:40,800 --> 06:40:45,680
Go over here to the teacher page, create a new folder called billing.

5375
06:40:45,680 --> 06:40:48,800
Inside here, I'm going to create a new file.

5376
06:40:48,800 --> 06:40:50,480
I'm going to call this page.tsx.

5377
06:40:50,480 --> 06:40:53,360
And I'm just going to paste it over here.

5378
06:40:53,360 --> 06:40:55,040
Scroll up.

5379
06:40:55,040 --> 06:40:59,120
Select both of these with Command D.

5380
06:40:59,120 --> 06:41:02,160
I'm going to do teacher billing, like so.

5381
06:41:02,160 --> 06:41:03,680
Save it.

5382
06:41:03,680 --> 06:41:08,880
And most of this should be a single transaction.

5383
06:41:08,880 --> 06:41:12,240
And most of this should be pretty identical.

5384
06:41:12,240 --> 06:41:15,280
You know what?

5385
06:41:15,280 --> 06:41:19,200
It is basically identical, except for the name of the component.

5386
06:41:19,200 --> 06:41:20,720
So you can leave it like that.

5387
06:41:20,720 --> 06:41:26,400
So the teacher can have a billing history in case the teacher also bought something as a user.

5388
06:41:26,400 --> 06:41:30,720
So just to be clear, you can create a reusable component.

5389
06:41:30,720 --> 06:41:32,560
I just didn't get the time to do that.

5390
06:41:32,560 --> 06:41:35,920
So you can use a reusable component that applies to both of these.

5391
06:41:35,920 --> 06:41:38,400
So you don't have to repeat the same code.

5392
06:41:40,400 --> 06:41:40,960
All right.

5393
06:41:40,960 --> 06:41:46,560
So looking to our completed application, the next part we're going to do is handling edit course

5394
06:41:46,560 --> 06:41:47,680
and creating a course.

5395
06:41:47,680 --> 06:41:52,960
This is actually a little more complicated than you would expect because our course,

5396
06:41:52,960 --> 06:41:56,880
our course data is very, very extensive.

5397
06:41:56,880 --> 06:42:02,720
There is courses, there are sections, there's a chapter, there's even comments.

5398
06:42:02,720 --> 06:42:04,320
But it's pretty extensive.

5399
06:42:04,320 --> 06:42:10,240
And it's going to include also videos that we need to upload onto S3.

5400
06:42:10,240 --> 06:42:14,400
So let's take a look at the final application on how this is supposed to look like.

5401
06:42:14,400 --> 06:42:20,560
So when you create a course, it's going to create a default course like so.

5402
06:42:20,560 --> 06:42:25,360
But it's also going to take you to the edit page.

5403
06:42:25,360 --> 06:42:30,000
So the course is more like kind of like a draft where you can have a course,

5404
06:42:30,720 --> 06:42:35,520
whether it's not drafted versus whether it's published or not.

5405
06:42:35,520 --> 06:42:39,280
So you'll have a course, you can set up the course title, description.

5406
06:42:39,280 --> 06:42:42,080
I'm just going to put random things over here.

5407
06:42:42,080 --> 06:42:43,040
It doesn't really matter.

5408
06:42:43,040 --> 06:42:49,440
But then when you add a section, you can have that saved over here.

5409
06:42:49,440 --> 06:42:53,040
But you can also add a chapter for each section.

5410
06:42:53,040 --> 06:42:57,360
So this is kind of like the way Udemy has their setup.

5411
06:42:57,360 --> 06:42:59,760
But then over here, we have a chapter video.

5412
06:43:01,120 --> 06:43:03,280
And let's just put a random video up here.

5413
06:43:03,280 --> 06:43:11,360
When you hit save, what's going to happen is that this doesn't save the sections into the backend.

5414
06:43:11,360 --> 06:43:15,600
Right now, all the data you see here, this is stored on the front end.

5415
06:43:15,600 --> 06:43:19,440
This is for more of a UX perspective.

5416
06:43:19,440 --> 06:43:22,800
And we are going to store this state into Redux.

5417
06:43:22,800 --> 06:43:27,520
And the reason why we don't store this into the backend is because

5418
06:43:27,520 --> 06:43:31,680
if you just constantly make API calls just for any kind of little edit

5419
06:43:31,680 --> 06:43:34,160
to make it consistent between front end and backend,

5420
06:43:34,160 --> 06:43:39,360
whereas some people don't want you to store any kind of like front end state.

5421
06:43:39,360 --> 06:43:43,760
This is problematic because a lot of times when you have the save draft,

5422
06:43:43,760 --> 06:43:47,760
that's the user experience that most people expect.

5423
06:43:47,760 --> 06:43:53,440
When you save it, that is what you are saving onto the backend.

5424
06:43:53,440 --> 06:43:57,280
Anything here is ephemeral, temporary.

5425
06:43:57,280 --> 06:44:04,480
So you want to make sure none of this gets saved until someone hits save draft.

5426
06:44:04,480 --> 06:44:08,480
And this is kind of what we'll create.

5427
06:44:08,480 --> 06:44:11,440
And this is a very common user experience that you see

5428
06:44:11,440 --> 06:44:14,240
when you have something that's very large.

5429
06:44:14,240 --> 06:44:17,040
You don't want to publish it right away.

5430
06:44:17,040 --> 06:44:20,560
These are the type of user experiences that people expect.

5431
06:44:20,560 --> 06:44:23,200
And we're going to have that basic flow.

5432
06:44:24,960 --> 06:44:28,560
So to start off, we're going to have to create our backend.

5433
06:44:28,560 --> 06:44:31,600
And that's going to include different aspects,

5434
06:44:31,600 --> 06:44:36,640
such as creating the course and then updating the course

5435
06:44:36,640 --> 06:44:40,400
and also a separate endpoint for uploading video.

5436
06:44:40,400 --> 06:44:43,760
So let's get started with all of that.

5437
06:44:43,760 --> 06:44:46,720
Let's move all of this.

5438
06:44:46,720 --> 06:44:49,280
We're going to open up our directory.

5439
06:44:49,280 --> 06:44:51,840
We're going to close the client directory.

5440
06:44:51,840 --> 06:44:54,960
And we are going to go straight to course controller.

5441
06:44:54,960 --> 06:45:01,440
And below our get course, we're going to copy this.

5442
06:45:01,440 --> 06:45:06,560
And I'm going to paste it over here because we're going to create a new function.

5443
06:45:06,560 --> 06:45:10,240
And we're going to call this create course like so.

5444
06:45:10,240 --> 06:45:14,240
Inside here, I'm going to get rid of all of this.

5445
06:45:14,240 --> 06:45:18,800
And we're just going to get rid of most of this information.

5446
06:45:18,800 --> 06:45:20,240
We don't need it.

5447
06:45:20,960 --> 06:45:27,280
So what we're going to grab from the body is we're going to grab the teacher ID

5448
06:45:27,280 --> 06:45:32,960
and the teacher name because we need to grab that from the front end.

5449
06:45:32,960 --> 06:45:42,400
And then if teacher ID does not exist, or if the teacher name doesn't exist,

5450
06:45:42,400 --> 06:45:44,320
this is just extra validation.

5451
06:45:44,320 --> 06:45:57,120
We're just going to send to the front end that the message of teacher ID and name are required.

5452
06:45:57,120 --> 06:45:59,920
Otherwise, we're just going to have an error check,

5453
06:45:59,920 --> 06:46:03,920
making sure that people can't log in unless they're the correct teacher

5454
06:46:03,920 --> 06:46:06,640
or they have specified a teacher.

5455
06:46:06,640 --> 06:46:08,080
All right.

5456
06:46:08,080 --> 06:46:10,480
And then from here, we're just going to create a new course.

5457
06:46:10,480 --> 06:46:16,160
So as you saw the flow earlier, where we have the course, we create the course first.

5458
06:46:16,160 --> 06:46:21,280
We're just going to put the course with, you know, default values.

5459
06:46:21,280 --> 06:46:23,760
This is exactly what we're going to be doing over here.

5460
06:46:23,760 --> 06:46:30,160
And the first thing we want to do is we're going to import the UUID.

5461
06:46:30,160 --> 06:46:35,120
So we're going to say V4 as UUID V4.

5462
06:46:35,120 --> 06:46:37,840
And we're going to grab that from UUID.

5463
06:46:37,840 --> 06:46:41,120
Because when we create a course, we need a unique value.

5464
06:46:41,120 --> 06:46:43,680
That's what we're setting as the course when we create it.

5465
06:46:43,680 --> 06:46:49,840
And then from here, we're going to set the teacher ID as well as the teacher name

5466
06:46:49,840 --> 06:46:58,160
with the title being Untitled Course with a description of an empty string,

5467
06:46:58,160 --> 06:47:02,720
category of Uncategorized.

5468
06:47:02,720 --> 06:47:06,800
And then we're going to have an image.

5469
06:47:07,440 --> 06:47:09,760
We're going to not have an image for this.

5470
06:47:09,760 --> 06:47:19,680
We're going to have a price of zero with a level of beginner and status being a draft.

5471
06:47:19,680 --> 06:47:24,080
Initially, there's only draft and published for this.

5472
06:47:24,080 --> 06:47:27,840
And then we're also going to have sections, which is going to be an empty array,

5473
06:47:27,840 --> 06:47:32,240
as well as enrollments, which is also going to be an empty array.

5474
06:47:33,440 --> 06:47:40,080
And then from here, we're just going to do a wait new course dot save to save our course

5475
06:47:40,080 --> 06:47:41,280
that we just created.

5476
06:47:41,280 --> 06:47:47,120
And then on the front end, we're just going to set or send back the new course.

5477
06:47:47,120 --> 06:47:53,840
And we're just going to say new course or create course created successfully.

5478
06:47:53,840 --> 06:47:59,680
And we're going to say error creating course if there is a problem.

5479
06:47:59,680 --> 06:48:02,720
So that's pretty straightforward.

5480
06:48:04,400 --> 06:48:09,360
Now, what happens if we want to update the course when we hit that save draft, that save button,

5481
06:48:09,360 --> 06:48:14,320
then we need another function for this because this is creating the course,

5482
06:48:14,320 --> 06:48:17,200
but we want to update and change that information.

5483
06:48:17,200 --> 06:48:18,960
So that's going to be a separate endpoint.

5484
06:48:18,960 --> 06:48:24,800
So I am once again going to copy all of this, paste it over here,

5485
06:48:24,800 --> 06:48:28,480
and we are going to change a number of things.

5486
06:48:28,480 --> 06:48:31,600
So this is going to now be called update course.

5487
06:48:32,320 --> 06:48:37,360
We're going to change or we're going to grab some values that we grab from the front end.

5488
06:48:37,360 --> 06:48:43,680
So the front end is going to need to send us to the back end, the course ID through params.

5489
06:48:43,680 --> 06:48:47,920
And remember, params is more required value from the front end.

5490
06:48:47,920 --> 06:48:54,480
And then update data is going to be just the entire request body.

5491
06:48:54,480 --> 06:48:57,920
So like all the extra information that we're grabbing.

5492
06:48:58,960 --> 06:49:04,160
And also, we also want to grab the user ID as well,

5493
06:49:04,160 --> 06:49:06,640
and we can just grab that from Clerk Express.

5494
06:49:06,640 --> 06:49:09,360
So we just grab that as well.

5495
06:49:09,360 --> 06:49:12,720
That's more authentication purposes.

5496
06:49:12,720 --> 06:49:16,320
And we want to make sure we know that we are using the correct user.

5497
06:49:16,320 --> 06:49:23,920
And then from here, I'm going to do const course await course dot get course ID.

5498
06:49:23,920 --> 06:49:28,160
So we just we're going to grab the course based on the course ID.

5499
06:49:28,160 --> 06:49:33,120
So we have all of the information that we currently have on our back end, just to make sure, you know.

5500
06:49:33,120 --> 06:49:40,560
And then if the course does not exist, we are going to do res dot status.

5501
06:49:40,560 --> 06:49:51,600
404 dot JSON, we're going to say message is course not found, and we are going to return.

5502
06:49:51,600 --> 06:49:55,760
We're going to remove all of this right here for the if statement.

5503
06:49:56,640 --> 06:50:03,760
And we also need to check if course dot teacher ID does not equal to user ID.

5504
06:50:03,760 --> 06:50:07,920
So we need to make sure the user ID that is authenticated is the teacher.

5505
06:50:07,920 --> 06:50:13,840
So this is very good and important because creating a course and having it published,

5506
06:50:13,840 --> 06:50:15,920
it needs to be very correct.

5507
06:50:15,920 --> 06:50:20,400
So having very secure functionality for this is important.

5508
06:50:20,400 --> 06:50:24,800
So we're just going to say not authorized to update this course.

5509
06:50:26,000 --> 06:50:29,040
We're going to have that and we are going to return.

5510
06:50:29,040 --> 06:50:34,800
And then from here, we're just going to remove everything we did before.

5511
06:50:34,800 --> 06:50:42,880
And we just need to do one thing about the price because the price needs to be stored as basically

5512
06:50:42,880 --> 06:50:48,320
a number like an integer instead of decimals, because when you have a price,

5513
06:50:48,320 --> 06:50:53,440
you have if you're using US dollars, for example, you have fifteen dollars dot zero zero.

5514
06:50:54,080 --> 06:50:57,280
You need to convert that to fifteen hundred.

5515
06:50:57,280 --> 06:50:59,760
So we're basically multiplying it by one hundred.

5516
06:50:59,760 --> 06:51:05,200
This is important because you don't want to have integer issues.

5517
06:51:05,200 --> 06:51:15,760
So this should be update data, by the way, so const price is equal to parse int.

5518
06:51:15,760 --> 06:51:21,440
Update data dot price, we're going to keep it like that.

5519
06:51:22,000 --> 06:51:29,920
So if price is not a number, we're just going to do some checks to make sure everything works.

5520
06:51:29,920 --> 06:51:38,240
We're going to do res dot status 400 just in case we have a non number.

5521
06:51:38,240 --> 06:51:43,920
It's important to check stuff like this because pricing is a very important issue.

5522
06:51:43,920 --> 06:51:46,000
And then we're going to send an error to the front end.

5523
06:51:46,000 --> 06:51:48,480
Price must be a valid number.

5524
06:51:51,200 --> 06:51:55,760
From here, we're going to say return and below this, we're going to say update

5525
06:51:55,760 --> 06:52:00,640
data dot price is equal to price times one hundred.

5526
06:52:00,640 --> 06:52:05,440
So once we know it's a number, we're going to multiply it by one hundred, which is very important.

5527
06:52:05,440 --> 06:52:11,280
And then from here, we're going to update data dot sections.

5528
06:52:11,280 --> 06:52:20,640
Const sections data is equal to type of update data dot sections.

5529
06:52:20,640 --> 06:52:26,880
If this is equal to a string, we're going to parse it because when we have sections,

5530
06:52:26,880 --> 06:52:33,920
it's possible that we are sending a parsed version of the sections, which is a bunch of arrays.

5531
06:52:33,920 --> 06:52:36,800
So yeah, let me let me go through this real quick.

5532
06:52:36,800 --> 06:52:42,320
So if you go to the course model, you can see that we have a bit of a complicated scenario.

5533
06:52:42,320 --> 06:52:47,520
It's better to look at the seed data because this will automatically show in JSON format

5534
06:52:47,520 --> 06:52:48,560
of what we're looking at.

5535
06:52:49,680 --> 06:52:54,080
So for every course, we have a sections property.

5536
06:52:54,080 --> 06:53:01,520
So every section is going to have an ID title description and another property of chapters.

5537
06:53:01,520 --> 06:53:10,320
So it's basically a bunch of nested arrays with objects that have another nested array

5538
06:53:10,320 --> 06:53:11,040
and objects.

5539
06:53:11,040 --> 06:53:15,040
So every chapter is going to include all of this information.

5540
06:53:16,080 --> 06:53:21,360
And we're going to include all of that for every chapter for every section.

5541
06:53:21,360 --> 06:53:23,360
It's going to have its own set of chapters.

5542
06:53:23,360 --> 06:53:29,280
And chapters can have content as well as the video URL.

5543
06:53:29,280 --> 06:53:32,720
So this is kind of how this is set up.

5544
06:53:32,720 --> 06:53:39,920
So now I'm there might be a better way to set this up, better way to organize it.

5545
06:53:39,920 --> 06:53:44,800
I originally thought, you know, course, you can have that in one go.

5546
06:53:45,360 --> 06:53:49,840
But after doing it, after building this application, you know, it is possible that there

5547
06:53:49,840 --> 06:53:53,840
might be a better option by having a chapter individually.

5548
06:53:53,840 --> 06:54:00,480
That is the beauty of data modeling and schemas is that there's multiple ways, multiple

5549
06:54:00,480 --> 06:54:02,880
possible solutions that might be better.

5550
06:54:02,880 --> 06:54:06,320
But a lot of times there are a lot of tradeoffs.

5551
06:54:06,320 --> 06:54:13,840
The biggest negative downside of this is that when you're handling these sections, when

5552
06:54:13,840 --> 06:54:19,920
you want to modify it, you have to dig deep through this nested array or nested objects

5553
06:54:19,920 --> 06:54:23,120
as well to figure out what you want to change.

5554
06:54:23,120 --> 06:54:27,280
Like if you wanted to update this video, you have to go through the sections, then you

5555
06:54:27,280 --> 06:54:29,760
have to figure out chapters, then you have to do that video.

5556
06:54:29,760 --> 06:54:36,960
It is quite the pain and gets code a little bit convoluted and hard to understand sometimes.

5557
06:54:36,960 --> 06:54:42,960
So just getting you aware, because there's going to be some crazy logic happening.

5558
06:54:43,920 --> 06:54:48,080
And that's mostly because I'm just trying to find the right property.

5559
06:54:48,080 --> 06:54:48,720
That's all it is.

5560
06:54:48,720 --> 06:54:51,760
Nothing too fancy there.

5561
06:54:51,760 --> 06:54:55,840
So update that data of sections is what we're going to parse.

5562
06:54:55,840 --> 06:54:59,760
And we're going to do update data dot sections.

5563
06:54:59,760 --> 06:55:01,920
So this is if it's parsed or not.

5564
06:55:01,920 --> 06:55:10,960
And then from here, we want to remove the ID in case we want to replace it.

5565
06:55:10,960 --> 06:55:13,280
So let's grab the updates data.

5566
06:55:13,280 --> 06:55:16,320
It'll make sense when I write this out.

5567
06:55:16,320 --> 06:55:18,800
We're going to grab the sections data dot map.

5568
06:55:18,800 --> 06:55:20,880
We're going to grab the section.

5569
06:55:20,880 --> 06:55:22,800
We're going to put in any tag for now.

5570
06:55:22,800 --> 06:55:25,600
And we're going to do arrow function.

5571
06:55:25,600 --> 06:55:27,380
We're going to.

5572
06:55:27,380 --> 06:55:32,320
So we're going to spread out the sections array.

5573
06:55:32,320 --> 06:55:37,840
We're going to pass in the section ID and section ID.

5574
06:55:38,880 --> 06:55:43,840
If it doesn't exist, we are going to pass in UUID for.

5575
06:55:43,840 --> 06:55:45,920
So this is if it doesn't exist.

5576
06:55:45,920 --> 06:55:49,200
Otherwise, we just pass in what already exists for the ID.

5577
06:55:49,200 --> 06:55:52,240
And then we're also going to have the chapters.

5578
06:55:52,240 --> 06:55:56,560
We're going to replace section dot chapters with another map.

5579
06:55:56,560 --> 06:56:03,520
Chapter colon any with the nested or with the return object.

5580
06:56:03,520 --> 06:56:06,080
And we're going to spread out the chapter.

5581
06:56:07,360 --> 06:56:08,960
As well as a chapter ID.

5582
06:56:08,960 --> 06:56:16,960
So you're going to grab chapter of chapter ID, pass in UUID V4 and execute that.

5583
06:56:16,960 --> 06:56:22,720
So this is basically how we update the sections that we want.

5584
06:56:22,720 --> 06:56:26,000
So we cycle through every section.

5585
06:56:26,000 --> 06:56:28,880
Make sure we update that data.

5586
06:56:28,880 --> 06:56:33,840
And we can then replace whatever information we need.

5587
06:56:37,120 --> 06:56:40,640
We're also going to have to replicate the object.

5588
06:56:40,640 --> 06:56:45,840
So we're going to do object assign, grab the course.

5589
06:56:45,840 --> 06:56:54,000
That we have over here and we are going to pass in update data.

5590
06:56:54,000 --> 06:56:59,360
So we're basically replacing it with a new object.

5591
06:56:59,360 --> 06:57:06,160
And then once we're done with that, we are going to do a wait course dot save.

5592
06:57:06,160 --> 06:57:09,600
So we replaced our course with new information.

5593
06:57:09,600 --> 06:57:16,880
I know this part is a bit tricky, but for the most part, we're just merging our sections

5594
06:57:16,880 --> 06:57:19,200
together with the new data.

5595
06:57:19,200 --> 06:57:22,640
That's the main thing you have to understand.

5596
06:57:22,640 --> 06:57:24,800
And this should be just course.

5597
06:57:24,800 --> 06:57:31,520
And we can say course updated successfully and an error updating.

5598
06:57:31,520 --> 06:57:35,200
So now we have the update.

5599
06:57:35,200 --> 06:57:38,640
And for this course, we're doing the full crud.

5600
06:57:38,640 --> 06:57:40,960
So we're also going to do delete course.

5601
06:57:40,960 --> 06:57:49,120
So I'm going to go back, copy this over here from the create course, scroll down below

5602
06:57:49,120 --> 06:57:51,920
the update course, paste it.

5603
06:57:51,920 --> 06:57:55,600
And we are now going to call this delete course.

5604
06:57:55,600 --> 06:58:04,320
In here, or at least above the tribe block, we're going to do const course ID.

5605
06:58:04,320 --> 06:58:09,120
We're going to do rec dot params, do const user ID.

5606
06:58:09,120 --> 06:58:16,560
And we are again, grabbing that from get off, get the request, pass it in there.

5607
06:58:16,560 --> 06:58:22,880
And over here in this tribe block, we're going to do const course is equal to a weight

5608
06:58:22,880 --> 06:58:26,480
course dot get course ID.

5609
06:58:26,480 --> 06:58:27,840
So we're just double checking.

5610
06:58:27,840 --> 06:58:34,080
And again, let's scroll up because I don't want to rewrite this once again.

5611
06:58:35,680 --> 06:58:40,720
Copy all of this and we can replace everything over here.

5612
06:58:40,720 --> 06:58:46,880
And then we're going to change this to not authorized to delete this course.

5613
06:58:46,880 --> 06:58:49,360
Again, these are just safe checks.

5614
06:58:49,360 --> 06:58:52,400
Otherwise, it's pretty simple.

5615
06:58:52,400 --> 06:58:57,520
I'm going to remove this, say a weight course dot delete course ID.

5616
06:58:58,720 --> 06:59:02,640
And the message should be course deleted successfully.

5617
06:59:02,640 --> 06:59:09,040
And we don't need to bring any kind of data for this particular situation and error

5618
06:59:09,040 --> 06:59:10,240
deleting course.

5619
06:59:10,240 --> 06:59:16,160
So now if you take a look, we have course over here, we have update course, but this

5620
06:59:16,160 --> 06:59:18,720
does not handle uploading video.

5621
06:59:18,720 --> 06:59:21,920
And we're not going to do that just now.

5622
06:59:21,920 --> 06:59:26,800
We're going to do that a little bit later once we get to the S3 buckets.

5623
06:59:26,800 --> 06:59:32,080
And so we can upload onto our S3 buckets when we deal with more AWS things.

5624
06:59:32,080 --> 06:59:35,600
So for now, we're going to keep it like this.

5625
06:59:35,600 --> 06:59:38,720
And then we are now going to create course routes.

5626
06:59:38,720 --> 06:59:43,520
So if I go back to course routes over here, we need to add all the routes that we have

5627
06:59:43,520 --> 06:59:44,240
just created.

5628
06:59:44,240 --> 06:59:50,160
So below the list course, I'm going to do router dot post.

5629
06:59:51,840 --> 06:59:57,120
And over here, when we want to create a course, we want require auth.

5630
06:59:57,120 --> 07:00:01,120
And we want it specifically for this route.

5631
07:00:01,120 --> 07:00:03,840
And we want to import that.

5632
07:00:03,840 --> 07:00:13,120
So if you remember, we did require auth over here, which will gatekeep users, clerk and

5633
07:00:13,120 --> 07:00:16,160
all the transactions, but we didn't do it for course routes.

5634
07:00:16,160 --> 07:00:21,520
That's because we want it specifically for certain routes in our application.

5635
07:00:21,520 --> 07:00:22,800
So this is how we do that.

5636
07:00:22,800 --> 07:00:26,800
And then from here, we need to add the other ones.

5637
07:00:26,800 --> 07:00:31,040
So we're going to do router dot put slash colon course ID.

5638
07:00:31,040 --> 07:00:34,240
We're going to do require auth as well over here.

5639
07:00:34,240 --> 07:00:38,560
And this is where we're going to use something called malter.

5640
07:00:38,560 --> 07:00:43,440
Malter makes it so that we can upload files and images.

5641
07:00:43,440 --> 07:00:49,200
And it basically stores it temporarily until we upload it onto AWS.

5642
07:00:49,840 --> 07:00:52,800
So what we need to do is set up this malter.

5643
07:00:52,800 --> 07:01:02,000
And we are going to use malter dot memory storage and invoke it and make sure we import

5644
07:01:02,000 --> 07:01:02,500
malter.

5645
07:01:02,500 --> 07:01:08,080
So we're going to import malter from malter like so.

5646
07:01:08,080 --> 07:01:14,000
And I really thought I installed this.

5647
07:01:14,000 --> 07:01:17,200
So we're just going to cancel out our server.

5648
07:01:17,200 --> 07:01:19,760
We're going to do NPMI malter like so.

5649
07:01:20,560 --> 07:01:25,680
And I do think I did install it.

5650
07:01:25,680 --> 07:01:29,840
I just didn't install the @types/malter.

5651
07:01:29,840 --> 07:01:34,720
So you need the TypeScript types for malter so it doesn't yell at you.

5652
07:01:34,720 --> 07:01:36,080
And there you go.

5653
07:01:36,080 --> 07:01:46,400
We're going to run back our server up, close this terminal out, and then go back to upload

5654
07:01:46,400 --> 07:01:47,280
over here.

5655
07:01:47,280 --> 07:01:50,080
We have the upload working correctly.

5656
07:01:50,080 --> 07:02:01,760
But over here with the course, we are going to set upload dot single image like so.

5657
07:02:01,760 --> 07:02:04,800
And we are going to update our course.

5658
07:02:04,800 --> 07:02:07,440
Now, I ran out of time.

5659
07:02:07,440 --> 07:02:12,000
Originally, I was going to have the image upload, but things again were ballooning out

5660
07:02:12,000 --> 07:02:12,800
of control.

5661
07:02:12,800 --> 07:02:15,440
So I did not input this.

5662
07:02:15,440 --> 07:02:20,000
But for your sake, if you ever want to upload, we're going to be using this.

5663
07:02:20,000 --> 07:02:24,080
This malter will be used later on for uploading video.

5664
07:02:24,080 --> 07:02:26,880
So it's not completely useless in this regard.

5665
07:02:26,880 --> 07:02:33,600
And finally, we're going to do router dot delete colon course ID as well.

5666
07:02:33,600 --> 07:02:35,520
Require auth.

5667
07:02:35,520 --> 07:02:37,120
We're going to invoke that.

5668
07:02:37,120 --> 07:02:39,600
And we're going to bring in delete course.

5669
07:02:39,600 --> 07:02:44,640
So we now have CRUD functionality for our courses essentially.

5670
07:02:45,760 --> 07:02:47,760
All right.

5671
07:02:47,760 --> 07:02:50,400
So now we can move on to the front end.

5672
07:02:50,400 --> 07:02:51,840
So let's go over here.

5673
07:02:51,840 --> 07:02:54,160
We're just going to close everything out.

5674
07:02:54,160 --> 07:03:00,640
And now we can go to our client directory, go to source, go to API, and we can make our

5675
07:03:00,640 --> 07:03:02,480
connections to our back end.

5676
07:03:02,480 --> 07:03:10,080
So we're going to go back up to where we have all our courses, and it's a good time to start

5677
07:03:10,080 --> 07:03:12,560
organizing all our courses.

5678
07:03:12,560 --> 07:03:14,320
So I'm just going to copy this over.

5679
07:03:14,320 --> 07:03:19,120
You can see I have courses like this, and I'm going to paste it over here.

5680
07:03:19,120 --> 07:03:21,280
User clerk.

5681
07:03:21,280 --> 07:03:25,520
This is just a better way to organize your endpoints.

5682
07:03:25,520 --> 07:03:28,640
You can create different slices if you want to organize it that way.

5683
07:03:28,640 --> 07:03:34,480
But I prefer to have it in one location because it is not too many.

5684
07:03:34,480 --> 07:03:38,000
And we're going to keep it like this.

5685
07:03:40,160 --> 07:03:44,640
And then from here, I'm just going to copy the create transaction because the first one

5686
07:03:44,640 --> 07:03:50,400
we're going to handle is going to be update video or update course.

5687
07:03:50,400 --> 07:03:50,880
I'm sorry.

5688
07:03:50,880 --> 07:03:53,200
So update course.

5689
07:03:53,200 --> 07:03:55,680
This is going to be build on mutation.

5690
07:03:55,680 --> 07:03:58,560
We're going to pass in a course over here.

5691
07:03:58,560 --> 07:04:09,040
And on the next line, I'm going to pass in an array or actually an object with course

5692
07:04:09,040 --> 07:04:16,400
ID colon string form data will be a form data type.

5693
07:04:16,400 --> 07:04:18,880
We're going to save that.

5694
07:04:18,880 --> 07:04:27,440
Query should instead have the arguments of course ID and form data.

5695
07:04:27,440 --> 07:04:30,880
So this is what's going to be passed into our body.

5696
07:04:32,640 --> 07:04:39,520
And the URL is going to be courses slash course ID as we expect.

5697
07:04:39,520 --> 07:04:41,200
Make sure this is a template string.

5698
07:04:41,200 --> 07:04:44,400
And this should not be capitalized.

5699
07:04:44,400 --> 07:04:50,960
The method should be put for updates.

5700
07:04:50,960 --> 07:04:54,320
And finally, we're going to pass in form data.

5701
07:04:54,320 --> 07:05:02,160
And when we update the course, this is where invalidates tags is pretty nice and convenient.

5702
07:05:02,800 --> 07:05:07,600
We want to do result error is saved into Redux toolkit query.

5703
07:05:07,600 --> 07:05:10,480
We're going to pass in an array.

5704
07:05:10,480 --> 07:05:18,480
We're going to have a type colon of string courses like so with ID of course ID.

5705
07:05:18,480 --> 07:05:25,680
So basically what happens is when we have a list of courses, when we grab the get courses,

5706
07:05:25,680 --> 07:05:31,200
we're going to have the tag of courses saved into Redux toolkit query.

5707
07:05:32,560 --> 07:05:38,640
When we hit the update course, typically if you're not using any kind of tooling,

5708
07:05:38,640 --> 07:05:43,200
you would have to fetch or send a put request to update your course.

5709
07:05:43,200 --> 07:05:53,680
And then also have to retrieve updated information for this course because sometimes you have to

5710
07:05:53,680 --> 07:05:58,320
make a second request to get the updated list, like the updated course as well.

5711
07:05:58,880 --> 07:06:03,760
But by doing so, you don't have to worry about this because you invalidate the tags,

5712
07:06:03,760 --> 07:06:07,120
you're updating that specific course via course ID.

5713
07:06:07,120 --> 07:06:13,360
So let's say you updated the name of the course, it's going to refetch from the backend,

5714
07:06:13,360 --> 07:06:18,800
the outdated or invalidated course information.

5715
07:06:18,800 --> 07:06:23,040
So you're always going to have the updated information and it automatically handles it

5716
07:06:23,040 --> 07:06:23,840
for you.

5717
07:06:23,840 --> 07:06:26,800
It is kind of a pain if you don't have a tool like this.

5718
07:06:27,440 --> 07:06:29,360
React query does the same thing.

5719
07:06:29,360 --> 07:06:34,560
All right, so we have update course.

5720
07:06:34,560 --> 07:06:36,960
We also need create course as well.

5721
07:06:36,960 --> 07:06:43,840
So above here, I'm just going to copy the update course,

5722
07:06:43,840 --> 07:06:49,680
paste it over here and call this create course instead.

5723
07:06:49,680 --> 07:06:53,040
Now this is slightly different.

5724
07:06:53,040 --> 07:06:56,720
Instead of having course ID, we're going to have teacher ID.

5725
07:06:58,000 --> 07:07:01,520
Instead of form data, it's going to be teacher name, colon string.

5726
07:07:01,520 --> 07:07:05,200
In here is going to be a body.

5727
07:07:05,200 --> 07:07:14,080
And we are going to have a URL of just courses with post as the method.

5728
07:07:14,080 --> 07:07:18,720
And the body should just be a body tag like this.

5729
07:07:18,720 --> 07:07:22,160
And finally, invalidate tags.

5730
07:07:22,160 --> 07:07:26,960
This is pretty simple because we just want to fetch the entire list of the courses.

5731
07:07:26,960 --> 07:07:28,640
So we want to update that way.

5732
07:07:28,640 --> 07:07:35,120
And then finally, I'm going to copy create course.

5733
07:07:35,120 --> 07:07:38,960
We're going to have delete course as well.

5734
07:07:38,960 --> 07:07:41,520
It's a pretty simple delete course.

5735
07:07:41,520 --> 07:07:43,280
Build a mutation.

5736
07:07:43,280 --> 07:07:51,360
This right here should be message colon string instead.

5737
07:07:52,240 --> 07:07:55,040
And what we send to the back end should be a string.

5738
07:07:55,040 --> 07:08:03,120
The URL should be or the query argument is going to be a course ID.

5739
07:08:03,120 --> 07:08:09,360
This is going to be courses slash course ID like that.

5740
07:08:09,360 --> 07:08:12,160
The method should be a delete method.

5741
07:08:12,160 --> 07:08:16,000
Remove the body, invalidate tags of courses.

5742
07:08:16,000 --> 07:08:18,720
And we should be good to go.

5743
07:08:19,440 --> 07:08:20,560
So if I scroll down.

5744
07:08:20,560 --> 07:08:28,800
We can now put the courses that we created or the queries that we created.

5745
07:08:28,800 --> 07:08:30,880
Use create course mutation.

5746
07:08:30,880 --> 07:08:35,280
Use update course mutation.

5747
07:08:35,280 --> 07:08:40,480
And use delete course mutation like so.

5748
07:08:40,480 --> 07:08:46,480
All right, with our back end now set up, the first thing before we get to the page

5749
07:08:46,480 --> 07:08:52,240
where we are editing and creating a course, we want to create this particular page where

5750
07:08:52,240 --> 07:08:53,680
we have a list of courses.

5751
07:08:53,680 --> 07:09:00,400
And this list of courses is all the courses that, you know, all the teachers that have

5752
07:09:00,400 --> 07:09:02,320
put in the course into this system.

5753
07:09:02,320 --> 07:09:06,800
So you should be able to see that they have a view only course.

5754
07:09:06,800 --> 07:09:09,520
So they can't edit courses that are not theirs.

5755
07:09:10,640 --> 07:09:16,640
So we do want to have a create course button, which will allow us to create course that

5756
07:09:16,640 --> 07:09:19,600
will allow us to edit and delete that course.

5757
07:09:19,600 --> 07:09:21,600
But only if it's their course.

5758
07:09:21,600 --> 07:09:26,240
We also have a search functionality and categories.

5759
07:09:26,240 --> 07:09:27,920
This is all done on the front end.

5760
07:09:27,920 --> 07:09:30,720
So it's based on that.

5761
07:09:30,720 --> 07:09:34,560
So if I do advanced, so it's all searching on the front end.

5762
07:09:34,560 --> 07:09:38,640
So we're going to go through this pretty fast because this is pretty straightforward.

5763
07:09:38,640 --> 07:09:44,960
So we are going to go to dashboard, go to teacher, create a new folder.

5764
07:09:44,960 --> 07:09:46,800
We're going to call this courses.

5765
07:09:46,800 --> 07:09:50,400
And inside here, I'm going to say page.tsx.

5766
07:09:50,400 --> 07:10:01,440
And inside here, I'm going to do rafce, call this courses page, and I'm going to start.

5767
07:10:01,440 --> 07:10:06,720
So we're going to grab the router from use router in Next Navigation.

5768
07:10:07,600 --> 07:10:08,800
Grab that.

5769
07:10:08,800 --> 07:10:12,400
We're going to grab user from use user.

5770
07:10:12,400 --> 07:10:14,000
That's going to be coming from clerk.

5771
07:10:14,000 --> 07:10:22,320
And then we're also going to grab the list of courses via data courses is loading is

5772
07:10:22,320 --> 07:10:25,520
error like so.

5773
07:10:25,520 --> 07:10:28,400
And we're going to do use get courses query.

5774
07:10:28,400 --> 07:10:33,200
Make sure it is the plural one like so.

5775
07:10:33,840 --> 07:10:39,040
And we are going to do category colon all like so.

5776
07:10:39,040 --> 07:10:46,160
And then we also have a couple functions that we are going to use for like the API calls.

5777
07:10:46,160 --> 07:10:51,280
So create course is going to be from use create course mutation.

5778
07:10:51,280 --> 07:10:52,960
So we created that already.

5779
07:10:52,960 --> 07:10:56,400
We're also going to grab delete course.

5780
07:10:56,400 --> 07:10:59,920
And that's going to from use delete course as you expect.

5781
07:11:00,960 --> 07:11:02,480
Mutation like so.

5782
07:11:02,480 --> 07:11:09,920
And then we are also going to have a state for search term, set search term.

5783
07:11:09,920 --> 07:11:12,800
And we are going to set use state.

5784
07:11:12,800 --> 07:11:14,800
Grab that from react.

5785
07:11:14,800 --> 07:11:25,920
Put an empty string as a default and also selected category set selected category as well.

5786
07:11:27,600 --> 07:11:30,880
And we're going to do use state pass in all.

5787
07:11:30,880 --> 07:11:36,640
Now I'm not going to go through this part.

5788
07:11:36,640 --> 07:11:42,160
I'm just going to copy this part because right now I want to get through this a little bit

5789
07:11:42,160 --> 07:11:42,880
quicker.

5790
07:11:42,880 --> 07:11:45,280
We're getting to the end of the application.

5791
07:11:45,280 --> 07:11:47,600
So we want to import use memo.

5792
07:11:47,600 --> 07:11:50,640
But this is a filter course.

5793
07:11:50,640 --> 07:11:55,200
All it's doing is if courses doesn't exist, we're going to filter through make sure it

5794
07:11:55,200 --> 07:11:59,120
matches the title of the course for their search.

5795
07:11:59,120 --> 07:12:04,240
And we are also making sure the category is matching for the selected categories that

5796
07:12:04,240 --> 07:12:05,040
we have.

5797
07:12:05,040 --> 07:12:10,240
So it's basically just a simple logic that filters all the categories that we need.

5798
07:12:10,240 --> 07:12:12,880
And we're memorizing it just for performance purposes.

5799
07:12:12,880 --> 07:12:21,440
And then below, I'm going to copy this and paste it over here.

5800
07:12:21,440 --> 07:12:24,960
Pretty straightforward, but I'm going to go through each one.

5801
07:12:25,520 --> 07:12:27,840
So there's going to be three functionalities.

5802
07:12:27,840 --> 07:12:31,440
Handle edit is going to be a button that's going to exist.

5803
07:12:31,440 --> 07:12:34,720
So let me create a course.

5804
07:12:34,720 --> 07:12:40,880
And go back to courses and you're going to be able to see there's an edit and delete.

5805
07:12:40,880 --> 07:12:46,640
So this edit course is going to be a button that takes us to that specific page.

5806
07:12:46,640 --> 07:12:52,960
Handle delete is going to be another button that takes us to or that basically asks us

5807
07:12:52,960 --> 07:12:54,560
if we want to delete the course.

5808
07:12:54,560 --> 07:12:56,480
And we're going to make sure we delete the course.

5809
07:12:56,480 --> 07:13:03,120
And then handle create course will be this specific button up here where we create the

5810
07:13:03,120 --> 07:13:03,520
course.

5811
07:13:03,520 --> 07:13:08,880
We're going to call the function that we created pass in teacher ID as well as the name.

5812
07:13:08,880 --> 07:13:15,280
And then we're going to make sure we take the user to that specific edit page.

5813
07:13:15,280 --> 07:13:22,400
So teacher courses, course ID, that's the page that the URL where we edit the course

5814
07:13:22,400 --> 07:13:23,280
when we hit edit.

5815
07:13:24,080 --> 07:13:24,640
All right.

5816
07:13:24,640 --> 07:13:33,840
And then from here, I'm going to do if is loading, we're going to return loading component.

5817
07:13:33,840 --> 07:13:36,320
So we're going to import that loading component.

5818
07:13:36,320 --> 07:13:45,200
And then if is error, we're going to make sure courses does exist for us to enter our

5819
07:13:45,200 --> 07:13:45,760
logic.

5820
07:13:45,760 --> 07:13:48,720
We're going to do error loading courses.

5821
07:13:48,720 --> 07:13:50,960
If some of them have a problem.

5822
07:13:50,960 --> 07:13:58,480
And now in here, I'm going to say class name is equal to teacher dash courses.

5823
07:13:58,480 --> 07:14:05,280
And in here with the courses, we are going to pass in Heather and that's going to come

5824
07:14:05,280 --> 07:14:07,200
from our components.

5825
07:14:07,200 --> 07:14:10,080
So title should be courses.

5826
07:14:10,080 --> 07:14:15,280
And then also subtitle should be course.

5827
07:14:16,240 --> 07:14:22,800
And then also subtitle should be browse your courses like so.

5828
07:14:22,800 --> 07:14:24,480
And we're going to have a right element.

5829
07:14:24,480 --> 07:14:26,880
Pass this in.

5830
07:14:26,880 --> 07:14:35,440
We're going to have a button component coming from ShadCN and we're going to set on click.

5831
07:14:35,440 --> 07:14:42,240
And we are going to pass in handle create course, which is what we created earlier.

5832
07:14:43,040 --> 07:14:51,840
And we're going to set class name to be teacher dash courses underscore header like so.

5833
07:14:51,840 --> 07:14:54,320
Close this out.

5834
07:14:54,320 --> 07:14:56,480
We're going to have a create course button.

5835
07:14:56,480 --> 07:15:03,680
Close this Heather with a self-closing tag and we should be able to see Heather like

5836
07:15:03,680 --> 07:15:04,180
so.

5837
07:15:04,180 --> 07:15:12,720
And now from here, we're going to have a toolbar that we are going to create.

5838
07:15:12,720 --> 07:15:15,040
I'm going to put on search.

5839
07:15:15,040 --> 07:15:17,040
It's going to be set search.

5840
07:15:17,040 --> 07:15:20,080
Search term.

5841
07:15:20,080 --> 07:15:28,320
We're going to pass that in and on category change is equal to set selected category.

5842
07:15:28,320 --> 07:15:34,640
Pass that in and we are going to create the toolbar component, which we are going to

5843
07:15:34,640 --> 07:15:35,520
go over here.

5844
07:15:35,520 --> 07:15:40,080
Components create a new file called this toolbar dot TSX.

5845
07:15:41,600 --> 07:15:49,360
And I am going to do something I normally don't like to do, which is just copy and paste

5846
07:15:49,360 --> 07:15:50,400
a number of things.

5847
07:15:50,400 --> 07:15:52,880
I'm only doing this because.

5848
07:15:52,880 --> 07:16:00,480
This app has been quite large and it's getting to be quite long, so I'm going to do this.

5849
07:16:00,480 --> 07:16:02,240
I'm going to pass in.

5850
07:16:02,240 --> 07:16:10,960
On search on category change and we're going to grab toolbar props as well.

5851
07:16:12,320 --> 07:16:13,120
But from here.

5852
07:16:13,120 --> 07:16:19,120
We are going to add search term with use date.

5853
07:16:19,120 --> 07:16:24,560
So we are going to save that we're going to handle search as well.

5854
07:16:24,560 --> 07:16:31,760
And we're going to set the search term and when we hit on search, we're going to set

5855
07:16:31,760 --> 07:16:32,880
that value as well.

5856
07:16:32,880 --> 07:16:38,960
And I'm going to pace everything we need for this part.

5857
07:16:39,680 --> 07:16:42,880
So here we have a class name of toolbar.

5858
07:16:42,880 --> 07:16:51,520
This will be the input that you see over here and we are going to make sure we handle search

5859
07:16:51,520 --> 07:16:54,800
with the placeholder everything that you know and love.

5860
07:16:54,800 --> 07:16:57,040
Make sure we import.

5861
07:16:57,040 --> 07:16:59,200
At components.

5862
07:16:59,200 --> 07:17:07,760
Slash components like this and we are going to import everything else with select trigger.

5863
07:17:08,080 --> 07:17:09,120
Select value.

5864
07:17:09,120 --> 07:17:12,320
Select content.

5865
07:17:12,320 --> 07:17:22,960
And let me move this up so you can see this is everything you need.

5866
07:17:22,960 --> 07:17:30,640
This is a color and those are the hovers sections and we are going to grab at components select

5867
07:17:30,640 --> 07:17:31,200
items.

5868
07:17:34,640 --> 07:17:38,160
And course categories is just going to come from lib utils.

5869
07:17:38,160 --> 07:17:44,000
So I made sure to import that those are values so bit basically straightforward.

5870
07:17:44,000 --> 07:17:45,200
I didn't want to spend time.

5871
07:17:45,200 --> 07:17:50,240
I feel like sometimes some of this code is pretty redundant.

5872
07:17:50,240 --> 07:17:52,640
So but it's just building functionality.

5873
07:17:52,640 --> 07:17:58,960
So from there we are going to import at components toolbar.

5874
07:17:58,960 --> 07:18:01,440
Make sure that's imported and.

5875
07:18:02,480 --> 07:18:05,680
If you were to go to here we can do manage account.

5876
07:18:05,680 --> 07:18:16,720
And we can go to courses page and once again we need to do use client at the top.

5877
07:18:16,720 --> 07:18:26,640
And we should be able to see the toolbar and by the way I didn't show this but if you go

5878
07:18:26,640 --> 07:18:29,840
to your user this is a user I signed in with.

5879
07:18:30,880 --> 07:18:34,160
I changed this to user type of teacher.

5880
07:18:34,160 --> 07:18:36,880
That's why I'm able to see this particular page.

5881
07:18:36,880 --> 07:18:42,640
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to access unless you add this user type.

5882
07:18:42,640 --> 07:18:47,280
So now I've changed this person to a teacher so I can see search categories.

5883
07:18:47,280 --> 07:18:48,640
I can see the categories.

5884
07:18:48,640 --> 07:18:50,880
And so on.

5885
07:18:50,880 --> 07:19:00,320
All right so we have the courses we have the header and toolbar but we do need to add a

5886
07:19:00,320 --> 07:19:01,840
but we do need to display.

5887
07:19:01,840 --> 07:19:09,680
The list of courses so over here I'm going to do div class name.

5888
07:19:09,680 --> 07:19:18,160
With teacher dash courses.

5889
07:19:18,160 --> 07:19:24,560
Underscore grid like so and I'm going to pass in filtered courses.

5890
07:19:26,160 --> 07:19:30,880
And I'm going to map it out with course with an arrow function.

5891
07:19:30,880 --> 07:19:35,920
And I'm going to create a separate card specifically for this.

5892
07:19:35,920 --> 07:19:38,960
I'm going to call this teacher course card.

5893
07:19:38,960 --> 07:19:46,240
We're going to close this out and I'm going to have a key with course dot course id.

5894
07:19:46,240 --> 07:19:51,680
Course is equal to the course value on edit.

5895
07:19:53,120 --> 07:19:56,000
I'm going to pass in handle edit.

5896
07:19:56,000 --> 07:19:59,600
I'm going to pass in on delete for the props.

5897
07:19:59,600 --> 07:20:01,120
We're going to handle.

5898
07:20:01,120 --> 07:20:08,080
Delete will be the function and is owner.

5899
07:20:08,080 --> 07:20:14,000
We want to make sure that the owner is the only one who can modify it.

5900
07:20:14,000 --> 07:20:15,760
We already have checks on the back end.

5901
07:20:15,760 --> 07:20:16,960
We already have a class.

5902
07:20:16,960 --> 07:20:18,160
We already have a class.

5903
07:20:18,160 --> 07:20:19,680
We already have a class.

5904
07:20:19,680 --> 07:20:20,720
We already have a class.

5905
07:20:20,720 --> 07:20:21,760
We already have a class.

5906
07:20:21,760 --> 07:20:22,720
We already have a class.

5907
07:20:22,720 --> 07:20:23,680
We already have a class.

5908
07:20:23,680 --> 07:20:24,720
We already have a class.

5909
07:20:24,720 --> 07:20:25,760
We already have a class.

5910
07:20:25,760 --> 07:20:26,720
We already have a class.

5911
07:20:26,720 --> 07:20:27,760
We already have a class.

5912
07:20:27,760 --> 07:20:28,720
We already have a class.

5913
07:20:28,720 --> 07:20:29,760
We already have a class.

5914
07:20:29,760 --> 07:20:30,720
We already have a class.

5915
07:20:30,720 --> 07:20:31,760
We already have a class.

07:20:34,720 --> 07:20:35,680
We already have a class.

5920
07:20:35,680 --> 07:20:36,720
We already have a class.

5921
07:20:36,720 --> 07:20:37,680
We already have a class.

5922
07:20:37,680 --> 07:20:38,720
We already have a class.

5923
07:20:38,720 --> 07:20:39,760
We already have a class.

5924
07:20:39,760 --> 07:20:40,720
We already have a class.

5925

07:20:46,640 --> 07:20:47,600
We already have a class.

5932
07:20:47,600 --> 07:20:48,640
We already have a class.

5933
07:20:48,640 --> 07:20:49,840
We already have a class.

We already have a class.

5946
07:21:04,240 --> 07:21:05,440
